        {/* INTRO */}
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          This article explains, with U.S.-focused terminology and publicly available data, where
          rescue dogs actually come from. In common usage, a &ldquo;rescue dog&rdquo; means a dog that is
          adopted through a nonprofit rescue, municipal shelter, or private sheltering organization.
          The organizations that care for these dogs collect intake and outcome information using a
          shared vocabulary. We will use that vocabulary, define every term we rely on, and describe
          what the national datasets can and cannot answer. The goal is purely informational. There
          is no advice, no prescriptions, and no stance on breeding, adoption, transport, or policy.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          At the national level, the most consistently reported pathways by which dogs enter the
          sheltering system are: <em>strays</em> (found at large or brought in as lost), <em>owner
          surrenders</em> (dogs relinquished by their caretakers), <em>transfers</em> (dogs moved between
          organizations), <em>confiscated/seized</em> (including cruelty, neglect, or hoarding cases),
          and <em>born in care</em> (puppies whelped after a pregnant dog entered). A much smaller but
          highly visible component is <em>international importation</em> for adoption. Most adoptions to
          the public happen in one of two ways: directly from a shelter, or via a rescue that first
          received the dog as a <em>transfer</em> from a shelter partner. The sections that follow walk
          through each source, summarize what the data say, and, equally important, where the data
          do not allow firm conclusions.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: HOW COUNTING WORKS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">How Counting Works: Core Definitions &amp; Why They Matter</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Any credible analysis of where rescue dogs come from has to start with definitions. U.S.
          sheltering organizations increasingly use standardized categories so that local data roll up
          into regional and national pictures without double-counting. Because many dogs move between
          organizations before adoption (for example, a municipal shelter transfers a dog to a
          foster-based rescue), national reporting typically separates <strong>community intake</strong> from
          <strong>transfers</strong>. That distinction prevents the same animal from being counted twice as a new
          entrant simply because it changed organizations.
        </p>

        <div className="rounded-xl border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f7f4ee] p-4 mb-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Standard Intake Categories (U.S. sheltering)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Stray/At-Large:</strong> A dog found without its owner, brought in by animal services
              or a member of the public. If the guardian later reclaims the dog, that is recorded as a
              <em> return-to-owner</em> outcome (RTO).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Owner Surrender:</strong> A dog relinquished by its legal guardian to a shelter or, in
              some regions, directly to a rescue (if that rescue accepts public surrenders).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transfer In:</strong> A dog received from another sheltering organization. Transfers help
              align supply and demand for adoptable dogs across regions, but they are not counted as new
              <em> community intakes</em> in national models to avoid double-counting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confiscated/Seized/Protective Custody:</strong> A dog taken in under legal authority,
              commonly linked to cruelty, neglect, dangerous dog proceedings, or hoarding investigations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Born in Care:</strong> Puppies whelped after a pregnant dog was admitted.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Why this matters: when someone asks, &ldquo;Do rescue dogs mostly come from licensed breeders,
          unlicensed breeders, or the street?&rdquo; they are often looking for a single percentage that
          does not actually exist in the underlying data. Intake forms rarely document the licensing
          status of a dog&rsquo;s breeder. Instead, the intake category tells you <em>how</em> the dog entered the
          system (lost, surrendered, seized, etc.). To understand breeder-related questions, analysts
          use <em>proxies</em> such as an animal&rsquo;s original acquisition source at the time of surrender
          (e.g., purchased from a breeder, acquired from a friend, adopted previously). Those proxies
          are informative but not a 1:1 map to &ldquo;licensed vs. unlicensed.&rdquo; This limitation will come up
          again in later sections.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: NATIONAL OVERVIEW */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">National Overview: The Big Picture of Intake</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          National summaries compiled from shelter and rescue reporting consistently show that the
          largest share of community intake is <strong>strays</strong>, followed by <strong>owner surrenders</strong>.
          Together, those two sources account for a substantial majority of dogs and cats who first
          enter the sheltering system in a given year. Transfers are also large in absolute terms, but
          remember that transfers represent movements between organizations, not new entries from the
          public. Seizures, hoarding rescues, disaster evacuations, and born-in-care cases add to the
          total but are smaller shares nationally compared with strays and owner surrenders.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The aggregate numbers vary year by year based on reporting coverage, community trends,
          disasters, disease-control measures, and local law. Seasonal patterns (e.g., summer
          surges), regional dynamics (e.g., differences between high-intake and high-adoption areas),
          and economic factors (e.g., housing availability for renters with pets) all influence the
          flow. Those drivers affect both the size of the intake stream and the composition of its
          sources.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: STRAYS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Strays: Lost Dogs as the Largest Single Source</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The stray category includes dogs who were roaming at large, loose without supervision, or
          otherwise separated from their guardians in the community. A portion of these dogs are
          reclaimed by their owners after impound, particularly when the dog is microchipped, wearing
          a collar with current identification, or impounded in a jurisdiction with strong return-to-owner
          practices. Another portion is not reclaimed and will be adopted, transferred to a rescue,
          or, in a subset of cases, experience other outcomes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Return-to-Owner (RTO):</strong> RTO is an outcome that directly offsets the number of stray
          dogs who will continue through the adoption pipeline. RTO rates differ by community and are
          affected by factors such as ID and microchip usage, licensing compliance, shelter location,
          field-services practices, and how finders are guided to reunification channels. Where dogs
          have robust identification, RTO rates tend to be higher than where dogs lack ID; this
          observation shows up repeatedly in municipal dashboards and case audits. Even with best
          practices, many stray dogs are never reclaimed and therefore become adoptable through shelters
          or rescues.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Seasonality:</strong> Stray inflow is not perfectly even year-round. Many agencies report
          elevated stray intake in warmer months, during holidays associated with fireworks (notably
          around early July), and after severe weather events. Because shelters often operate at or
          near capacity, seasonal spikes influence both length of stay and the volume of inter-agency
          transfers needed to balance capacity in neighboring regions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Public-health and bite holds:</strong> A small fraction of stray intakes arrive with bite
          reports or quarantine requirements. These cases are managed under local public-health rules.
          While numerically modest, they affect operations because they extend length of stay and may
          limit placement options until legal requirements are satisfied.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: OWNER SURRENDERS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Owner Surrenders: Human-Side &amp; Animal-Side Reasons</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Owner surrenders are dogs relinquished by their guardians. Intake paperwork typically
          captures a reason, but reason fields are not perfectly standardized across all organizations.
          Modern summaries cluster reasons into broader groups such as <em>housing</em> (e.g., landlord or
          moving issues), <em>financial</em> (e.g., cost of care), <em>caretaker health/life events</em>, <em>behavior or
          compatibility</em>, and <em>too many animals</em>. Analyses across multiple years generally show that
          <strong>human-side reasons</strong> (housing, life changes, family constraints) are cited more often than
          strictly animal-side reasons. That does not mean behavior is trivial; behavior and
          compatibility do appear frequently, especially for adolescent and young-adult dogs, but the
          human context surrounding housing and stability is persistent across datasets.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Acquisition-source information:</strong> When available, surrender forms sometimes record how
          the owner originally acquired the dog: purchased from a breeder, adopted from a shelter,
          acquired from a friend or relative, taken in as a stray, or received as part of an
          accidental litter. Multi-year analyses indicate that dogs acquired informally in the
          community‚Äîsuch as being &ldquo;given&rdquo; or &ldquo;rehomed&rdquo; by another person, or kept from a litter‚Äîare
          over-represented among surrender cases compared with their overall share in household
          acquisition surveys. Conversely, dogs previously <em>purchased</em> from breeders or <em>adopted</em> from
          shelters tend to be under-represented among surrenders relative to their prevalence in the
          owned-dog population. This pattern helps answer the breeder question indirectly: the data
          do not tag breeder licensing status, but surrender composition suggests that the dominant
          intake sources reflect community dynamics (informal exchange and found animals), not direct,
          routine relinquishments from licensed commercial breeding programs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Appointment vs. emergency surrender:</strong> Many shelters use appointments to triage
          surrenders so that capacity matches daily intake. Emergency surrenders may occur immediately
          (e.g., hospitalization, eviction, unsafe situation). Appointment models influence reported
          daily intake and length-of-stay distributions; they also drive the timing of transfers when
          partner rescues can accept dogs more quickly.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: TRANSFERS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Transfers: How Dogs Move from Shelters to Rescues (and Back)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Transfers are movements between organizations. They are central to how many rescue dogs
          arrive at the group that ultimately adopts them out. In practice, a common path is:
          <em> municipal or contracted shelter intake &rarr; health and behavior evaluation &rarr; transfer to a
          foster-based rescue &rarr; adoption to the public.</em> Transfers allow high-intake shelters to
          reduce crowding, shift dogs into home-based care to ease stress, and place animals with
          groups that have adopter pools suited to the dog&rsquo;s profile. Conversely, rescues sometimes
          transfer dogs <em>back</em> to shelters that have full-service veterinary capacity or broader walk-in
          foot traffic.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Counting rule:</strong> National aggregations typically exclude transfers from community-intake
          counts so that a dog that moves twice is not counted as two new entries. Instead, transfers
          are tracked as their own category. At a local level, individual organizations report both
          their community intake and their transfers in and out; regionally, the net flow of transfers
          shows where capacity or demand imbalances exist.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Relocation programs:</strong> Large-scale relocation transports move dogs from areas with
          higher intake and longer lengths of stay to regions with faster adoption throughput. This is
          especially common between some Southern states and Northeastern or Upper Midwestern states.
          Well-run programs coordinate health certificates, vaccination timing, and post-arrival
          intake at destination shelters and rescues. In effect, relocation functions like a national
          balancing valve for adoptable-dog supply and adopter demand.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: CONFISCATIONS / HOARDING */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Confiscations, Cruelty Cases &amp; Hoarding</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Confiscated or seized intakes occur under legal authority. They include dogs removed during
          cruelty or neglect investigations, hoarding cases, and cases where an owner is detained or
          hospitalized and no caretaker is available. Relative to strays and owner surrenders, these
          cases are a <em>smaller</em> share numerically at the national level but command significant resources
          because they often arrive in clusters and require specialized medical, behavioral, and legal
          handling. Large-scale seizures from substandard commercial operations can involve dozens to
          hundreds of dogs at once, while hoarding cases can involve mixed populations over multiple
          years.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Operational impact:</strong> Seizure and hoarding cases affect length of stay because many
          dogs remain in protective custody until legal proceedings conclude. They also skew resource
          use toward medical care, forensic documentation, and behavior support. Even if the absolute
          numbers are smaller than other categories, the ripple effects on capacity management are
          substantial for the agencies involved.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Data visibility:</strong> Law-enforcement sensitivity and ongoing litigation sometimes limit
          the level of public detail available for these cases. National rollups generally capture
          them under &ldquo;confiscated,&rdquo; &ldquo;seized,&rdquo; or &ldquo;protective custody&rdquo; without further breakdown by
          alleged offense. That means the national picture can confirm the category&rsquo;s existence and
          relative size, but not publish a unified national percentage for sub-types such as hoarding
          versus organized cruelty.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: BORN IN CARE */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Born in Care: Pregnant Intakes &amp; Puppy Litters</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When a pregnant dog enters a shelter or rescue and whelps after intake, her puppies are
          recorded as <em>born in care</em>. This category does not reflect dogs arriving from outside the
          community; it reflects <em>new</em> animals created inside the system as a result of an earlier
          intake. The prevalence of born-in-care cases varies by region and by how frequently pregnant
          dogs are admitted. In some communities, intake appointment systems and spay/neuter access
          influence how often late-term pregnancies present to shelters; in others, field services or
          emergency circumstances (fire, flood, eviction) drive the pattern.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Born-in-care litters can be adoption positives‚Äîhealthy, behaviorally normal puppies are
          generally in high adopter demand‚Äîbut they also increase veterinary workload (prenatal care,
          neonatal care, round-the-clock fostering) and can lead to length-of-stay challenges if many
          litters arrive in a short window. Tracking this category separately clarifies that these
          puppies did <em>not</em> originate from breeder surrenders or the street; they originated from an
          earlier intake of a pregnant dog.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: INTERNATIONAL IMPORTS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">International Imports: Separate from Domestic Intake</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A distinct question is how many dogs adopted in the U.S. were <em>imported</em> from other
          countries. Federal authorities regulate dog importation for public-health reasons, including
          rabies control, microchipping requirements, and vaccination documentation. Various rescue
          organizations participate in international adoption programs, often in response to natural
          disasters abroad or chronic overpopulation in particular regions. These programs exist, and in
          some metro areas they are well known, but they are <strong>separate</strong> from the domestic
          community-intake flows described earlier.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          National sheltering datasets do not publish a single, authoritative annual count of how many
          imported dogs enter U.S. rescues and shelters for adoption. Instead, the federal side reports
          on import requirements and volumes for all purposes (personal pets, commerce, and rescue).
          When comparing scales, it is critical to note that domestic community intake for dogs numbers
          in the millions each year across the U.S., while international rescue imports, even when
          substantial for individual organizations, represent a narrower pipeline relative to the size
          of domestic flows.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: LICENSED VS UNLICENSED */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Licensed vs. Unlicensed Breeders: What Intake Data Can&apos;t Tell You Directly</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A frequent public question is whether &ldquo;most rescue dogs&rdquo; come from licensed breeders,
          unlicensed or informal breeders (often called &ldquo;backyard breeders&rdquo; in colloquial speech), or
          from accidental litters. Intake forms generally do <em>not</em> capture the licensing status of a
          dog&rsquo;s breeder at the time a dog enters a shelter or rescue. U.S. federal licensing under the
          Animal Welfare Act applies to specific commercial-selling scenarios, especially sight-unseen
          sales past certain thresholds, while many face-to-face sellers and small-scale hobby
          operations are outside federal licensing. State and local laws add another layer of
          variation, but these nuances do not appear on a typical intake record.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Because of this, national analyses rely on proxies such as the owner&rsquo;s <em>acquisition source</em>
          at surrender: purchased from a breeder, adopted, acquired from a friend, kept from a litter,
          found as a stray and kept, and so on. Across large datasets, community and informal
          acquisition sources are disproportionately represented among surrenders, while purchased and
          previously adopted dogs are under-represented relative to their prevalence in household
          surveys. This does not label breeder licensing, but it implies that routine, direct
          relinquishment of dogs from licensed commercial programs is not the dominant path by which
          dogs enter rescues and shelters. Instead, the dominant paths remain <strong>stray</strong> and
          <strong> owner-surrender</strong> from the general public.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: REGIONAL DYNAMICS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Regional Dynamics: Why Some Places Send &amp; Others Receive</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Intake pressure is unevenly distributed across the U.S. Some regions report higher
          per-capita intake and lower average return-to-owner rates than others. Conversely, some
          metro areas have adopter demand that exceeds local intake, leading to consistent transfer-in
          activity. Factors often cited include climate, year-round breeding seasons in warmer areas,
          historical spay/neuter access, community resources, rural-versus-urban density, and housing
          patterns for renters versus homeowners. Relocation and transfer partnerships are the
          mechanisms that move dogs from higher-intake regions to higher-demand regions to reduce
          euthanasia risk and length of stay.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Because these are <em>average</em> patterns, there are important exceptions. Some rural counties
          in colder regions have high intake relative to resources, and some Southern metro areas have
          strong adopter bases or robust rescue networks. The practical takeaway for our narrow
          question‚Äî&ldquo;Where do rescue dogs come from?&rdquo;‚Äîis simply that geography helps explain why a dog
          you adopt in one city may have started its journey hundreds or thousands of miles away.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: SEASONALITY */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Seasonality: When Intake Peaks &amp; Why That Matters</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Shelters commonly experience seasonal variation in intake. Warmer months see more stray
          intakes, both because dogs spend more time outdoors and because people are more likely to
          encounter and transport loose animals. Holiday fireworks and storm seasons contribute to
          lost-dog spikes. Puppies &ldquo;born in care&rdquo; also follow seasonal patterns because pregnant
          intakes cluster at certain times of the year. Seasonality matters for understanding origin
          because it changes the <em>mix</em> of intake sources in any given month, which in turn shifts how
          many dogs are available for direct adoption versus how many need transfers or longer medical
          holds before placement.

        {/* SECTION: RETURNS AFTER ADOPTION */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Returns After Adoption: A Minority Flow Back into Intake</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While not a primary source category, returns after adoption are a real component of intake
          over time. Return rates vary by shelter and by cohort but are generally a minority compared
          with total adoptions. Typical reasons include compatibility, behavior, landlord or housing
          conflicts, and life changes. These returns are recorded as owner surrenders and are included
          here for completeness, because they modestly shape the overall population available for
          placement.

        {/* SECTION: DATA QUALITY */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Data Quality, Methods &amp; Limits of What Can Be Claimed</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          National sheltering datasets are built from thousands of individual organizations that vary
          in software, staffing, and reporting practices. Even with improving standards, there are
          limitations that anyone interpreting &ldquo;where rescue dogs come from&rdquo; should respect:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Coverage &amp; consistency:</strong> Not every organization reports in every month or year.
            Aggregation models use statistical methods to estimate national totals from partial data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Definitions in practice:</strong> Category definitions are standardized, but front-desk
            workflows and legacy software fields vary. A case that looks like &ldquo;stray&rdquo; in one system might
            be coded as &ldquo;public drop-off&rdquo; in another unless staff are trained on the newest picklists.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double-counting risk:</strong> Transfers are handled separately in national rollups to
            avoid counting the same dog twice as a new entry. Analyses that mix community intakes and
            transfers without care will overstate totals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Acquisition-source proxy:</strong> Surrender forms that record where an owner originally
            got the dog provide useful context, but these fields are self-reported and not validated
            against paperwork in most jurisdictions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breeder licensing status:</strong> As emphasized earlier, intake records do not include a
            field that attaches federal or state breeder licensing status to individual dogs. Any claim
            about &ldquo;licensed vs. unlicensed&rdquo; origin at a national level would therefore be an inference,
            not a directly measured variable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          These limitations do not undermine the main picture‚Äîstrays and owner surrenders dominate
          community intake‚Äîbut they do set guardrails around more granular claims people sometimes want
          to make from the same data, especially about breeder licensing or specific sub-types of legal
          cases.

        {/* SECTION: FREQUENTLY ASKED CLARIFICATIONS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Frequently Asked Clarifications (Data-Only)</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Do most rescue dogs come from the street?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Strays</strong> are the largest single intake category nationally. Many of those dogs are
          reclaimed by their owners; many are not. The dogs who are not reclaimed become available for
          adoption and account for a significant share of &ldquo;rescue dogs&rdquo; adopted each year.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Are owner surrenders mostly behavior problems?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Reported reasons include both behavior and human-side drivers. Across large datasets and
          multiple years, <strong>human-side reasons</strong> (housing, financial pressure, caretaker health, life
          changes, too many animals) collectively appear more often than animal-only reasons. Behavior
          and compatibility are important and do contribute to returns and surrenders, but they are
          not the sole or even the dominant driver in aggregate reporting.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Are hoarding cases or large commercial seizures the main source?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No. They are a smaller share nationally compared with strays and owner surrenders, though
          their operational impact is disproportionately large when they occur. These cases often
          involve clusters of animals and lengthy legal holds that strain capacity.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Do national datasets identify licensed vs. unlicensed breeders?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No. Intake records do not include a standardized field that tags breeder licensing status.
          Analysts infer patterns using <em>acquisition source at surrender</em>, which indicates that dogs
          obtained via informal community routes are over-represented among surrenders, while
          purchased or previously adopted dogs are under-represented relative to their household
          prevalence. That proxy does not assign licensing status to individual breeders.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Are many rescue dogs imported from overseas?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Imports for adoption do occur and are visible in certain metro areas and specific program
          pipelines. They are regulated at the federal level for public health. National sheltering
          data, however, indicate that the <em>majority</em> of dogs adopted via U.S. shelters and rescues
          originate domestically through community intake (strays and owner surrenders) and subsequent
          transfers rather than through international pipelines.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: PRACTICAL READING GUIDE */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">How to Read National Numbers Without Over-Interpreting Them</h2>
        <div className="rounded-xl border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f7f4ee] p-4 mb-6">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Check the denominator:</strong> When you see a percentage, ask whether it is a
              percent of all <em>community intakes</em>, a percent of <em>all intakes including transfers</em>, or a
              percent of <em>dogs only</em> (not dogs + cats). Mixing denominators distorts comparisons.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Beware of double counting:</strong> A single dog can pass through multiple organizations
              on the way to adoption. National counts prevent double counting by handling transfers as a
              separate category. Local anecdotes that add organization-by-organization intakes without
              adjustment will overstate totals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Watch the time frame:</strong> Single-year spikes can reflect disasters, disease
              outbreaks, or reporting changes. Multi-year trends are more informative than one-year
              comparisons.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mind the missing fields:</strong> Breeder licensing information is not a standard intake
              field. Assertions that break down rescues by &ldquo;licensed vs. unlicensed breeders&rdquo; are not
              supported by the data collected at intake.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use proxies carefully:</strong> Acquisition-source data at surrender help answer
              questions about where owned dogs originally came from, but they are self-reported and, by
              definition, do not apply to strays (who have no surrendering owner filling out a form).
            </li>
          </ul>

        {/* SECTION: CASE EXAMPLES */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Neutral Case Examples Illustrating the Pathways</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Case A: The Unclaimed Stray</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A medium-sized adult dog is found wandering in a suburban neighborhood and picked up by
          animal services. The dog has no collar, and a microchip scan shows no chip. After the
          legally required stray hold passes with no owner coming forward, the dog is vaccinated,
          evaluated, and placed up for adoption. A local foster-based rescue pulls the dog as a
          <em> transfer</em> and places it in foster care. Two weeks later, the dog is adopted. This dog&rsquo;s origin
          in the rescue system is <strong>stray intake</strong> at a municipal shelter, even though the adoption
          occurred through a rescue organization.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Case B: Owner Surrender with Housing Constraints</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A family is moving to an apartment that does not allow dogs over a certain weight. They
          attempt to rehome the dog among friends without success and ultimately book a surrender
          appointment with their local shelter. Intake paperwork lists &ldquo;housing&rdquo; as the primary
          reason. After evaluation, the dog is matched to a new adopter directly from the shelter.
          This dog&rsquo;s origin is <strong>owner surrender</strong>, and its pathway did not require transfer.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Case C: Protective Custody &amp; Legal Hold</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Several dogs are removed from a property under a cruelty investigation. They enter the
          shelter as <strong>confiscated</strong> and are held in protective custody. Some require medical care for
          untreated conditions; all require behavior assessment after stabilization. After a court
          order permits disposition, some dogs are adopted directly; others transfer to specialized
          rescues with capacity for extended rehabilitation. This cluster of cases is smaller in
          national percentage terms but heavy in resource use.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Case D: Pregnant Intake &amp; Born in Care</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A pregnant dog is surrendered by her owner just before whelping. She delivers at the
          shelter. The puppies are recorded as <em>born in care</em>. After weaning and age-appropriate
          vaccination, the puppies are adopted. These puppies did not originate from a breeder
          surrender, the street, or a transfer; they originated from a <strong>pregnant owner surrender</strong>
          that produced a litter inside the system.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: SUMMARY */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Summary: Where Rescue Dogs Come From (U.S., Data-Only)</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            The <strong>largest single source</strong> of intake is <strong>strays</strong> (lost dogs entering through
            municipal or private shelters). Many are reclaimed; many are not and become adoptable.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>second-largest source</strong> is <strong>owner surrenders</strong>, with human-side drivers such as
            housing and life changes frequently cited alongside compatibility/behavior issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transfers</strong> are a major movement channel between organizations and explain why many
            dogs adopted from rescues originally entered the system at shelters. National models treat
            transfers separately to avoid double-counting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confiscated/seized</strong> (including hoarding and cruelty cases) and <strong>born in care</strong> add to
            totals but, nationally, are smaller than strays and owner surrenders in most reporting years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>International imports</strong> for adoption exist under public-health rules but are separate
            from the dominant domestic intake flows and do not account for the majority of placements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intake data do <strong>not</strong> record <em>breeder licensing status</em>. Proxies based on owner
            acquisition at surrender suggest that informally acquired dogs are over-represented in
            surrenders relative to their general ownership prevalence; purchased and previously adopted
            dogs are under-represented. This pattern informs, but does not conclusively resolve,
            breeder-licensing questions.
