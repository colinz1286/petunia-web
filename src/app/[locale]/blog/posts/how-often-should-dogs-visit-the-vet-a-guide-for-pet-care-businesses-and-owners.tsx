                <p className="mb-4">
                    When I started my dog boarding and daycare business eight years ago, vet visits weren‚Äôt just paperwork‚Äîthey became a window into how seriously people care for their dogs.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    I quickly realized that many owners either forget vaccines or aren‚Äôt aware how often their dogs should be seen. That‚Äôs why I created the Petunia app ‚Äî to help bridge that gap. But even beyond reminders, knowing how often your dog should visit the vet is a foundational part of good care.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    This guide brings together what I‚Äôve seen in the industry and current guidelines from AVMA, AAHA, WSAVA, RCVS, and other veterinary sources ‚Äî from puppies to seniors, chronic conditions to breed risks, and global standards.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4 italic">
                    I‚Äôm not a vet ‚Äî just someone deeply embedded in the care side of this work. Please always consult your own veterinarian for personalized advice.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üö® Section 1: Puppies ‚Äî Every Few Weeks for the First 4‚Äì5 Months</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Puppy owners often book daycare within days of getting their dog ‚Äî which I understand. But veterinary care in those first months is critical.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Based on current standards, puppies need vet visits every 3‚Äì4 weeks from 6‚Äì8 weeks old until about 16‚Äì20 weeks. These include:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Physical exam and weight tracking</li>
                    <li>Stool test for parasites</li>
                    <li>Vaccine boosters (Distemper, Parvo, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Rabies vaccine at ~16 weeks (legally required)</li>
                    <li>Optional vaccines: Bordetella, Lepto, Influenza</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    At my facility, we require full puppy vaccines before boarding or daycare. And yes ‚Äî we turn pups away all the time if they‚Äôre not done. It‚Äôs about safety for everyone.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üìÖ Section 2: Adult Dogs ‚Äî The Annual Check-Up Is Mandatory</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Most adult dogs (age 1‚Äì7) should be seen annually for a wellness exam. Even if they seem healthy.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">A typical visit includes:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Physical exam (weight, heart, eyes, teeth, skin, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Review of diet, behavior, and medications</li>
                    <li>Vaccines: DHPP (1‚Äì3 year), Rabies (as required), Lepto/Bordetella if applicable</li>
                    <li>Heartworm test and fecal exam</li>
                    <li>Optional bloodwork or baseline diagnostics</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Annual Visits Still Matter</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Clients often ask: ‚ÄúThey look fine. Do we really need it?‚Äù And the answer is always yes.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    I‚Äôve seen vets catch early kidney disease, dental issues, and weight gain before it‚Äôs visible to the owner. Preventive care prevents emergencies ‚Äî and it‚Äôs why we encourage these visits before dogs board with us.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üëµ Section 3: Senior Dogs ‚Äî Twice a Year at Minimum</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    For most breeds, ‚Äúsenior‚Äù begins at age 7. For large/giant breeds, it‚Äôs often 5 or 6. At this point, twice-yearly exams are recommended.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">These visits typically include:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Full physical exam</li>
                    <li>Bloodwork every 6‚Äì12 months</li>
                    <li>Possible imaging (X-rays, ultrasound)</li>
                    <li>Mobility and pain assessments</li>
                    <li>Nutrition review and supplement guidance</li>
                    <li>Monitoring for vision, hearing, and cognition changes</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    I‚Äôve seen a huge difference in quality of life for dogs whose conditions (like arthritis or kidney decline) were caught early. I‚Äôm more comfortable boarding seniors when I know their care is active and ongoing.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">ü©∫ Section 4: Chronic Conditions ‚Äî Tailor Frequency to the Dog</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Some dogs ‚Äî regardless of age ‚Äî need more frequent care due to medical conditions. For example:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Dogs with diabetes or thyroid disease: visits every 3‚Äì6 months</li>
                    <li>Arthritis or orthopedic cases: joint checks, medication monitoring</li>
                    <li>Allergies or ear infections: frequent visits during flare-ups</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    In my experience, many pet owners don‚Äôt notice subtle signs: dry coat, scratching, slow movement. I often flag them ‚Äî and suggest a vet check. If that leads to early diagnosis, everyone wins.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üêï Section 5: Breed and Size Matter ‚Äî Tailored Vet Schedules</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Not all dogs age the same ‚Äî and certain breeds have specific needs. Here are some examples:
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Large / Giant Breeds</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Age faster ‚Äî senior status by age 5‚Äì6</li>
                    <li>Higher risk of joint problems, heart disease, bloat (GDV)</li>
                    <li>Vets may recommend early imaging and wellness labs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Brachycephalic Breeds (Short-Nosed Dogs)</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Pugs, Bulldogs, Shih Tzus, Frenchies, etc.</li>
                    <li>Prone to overheating and respiratory stress</li>
                    <li>Vet visits may include airway evaluations or special care before travel</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Small Breeds</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Dental disease shows up earlier ‚Äî cleanings may be more frequent</li>
                    <li>Common issues: tracheal collapse, patellar luxation, heart murmurs</li>
                    <li>Regular vet checkups can catch and manage these early</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Breed-Specific Screening</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels: heart screenings</li>
                    <li>Boxers: cardiac ultrasounds for cardiomyopathy</li>
                    <li>Labs & Shepherds: early hip and joint evaluations</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    I recommend every pet owner ask their vet: ‚ÄúAre there breed-specific risks I should monitor for?‚Äù The earlier you catch them, the better the outcome.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üåç Section 6: Global Guidelines ‚Äî How Visit Frequency Varies</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    While my experience is based in the U.S., I‚Äôve worked with clients transferring in from other countries ‚Äî and it‚Äôs helpful to know how standards differ worldwide:
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">United States &amp; Canada</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Puppies: every 3‚Äì4 weeks until 16‚Äì20 weeks old</li>
                    <li>Adults: annual wellness exam</li>
                    <li>Seniors: every 6 months (or more for large breeds)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">United Kingdom</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Annual checkups for healthy adults</li>
                    <li>Seniors: twice yearly with bloodwork or imaging</li>
                    <li>Similar vaccine timelines to U.S.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Australia &amp; New Zealand</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Similar guidance ‚Äî more regional flexibility</li>
                    <li>Seniors typically seen every 6 months</li>
                    <li>Vaccines may vary by regional disease risk (e.g. Lepto)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Ireland</h3>

                    <li>Six-month senior visits encouraged starting age 7+</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Despite local nuance, one theme is universal: puppies need frequent visits, adults need annual checkups, and seniors benefit from twice-a-year care ‚Äî no matter where you live.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üìë Section 7: Vaccination &amp; Boarding Documentation ‚Äî My Facility‚Äôs Perspective</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    If there‚Äôs one policy I enforce without exception: no current vaccines, no boarding. Period.
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Rabies:</strong> Legally required in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, and Ireland. Most dogs receive it at 16 weeks, then again at 1 year, then every 1‚Äì3 years depending on vaccine and jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distemper/Parvo (DHPP):</strong> Required by most facilities ‚Äî and often state law ‚Äî before boarding is allowed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bordetella:</strong> Not always legally required, but essential for boarding environments with high dog interaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    In my business, we check proof of vaccination every time. If anything is expired, we cannot accept the dog ‚Äî for their safety, and everyone else‚Äôs.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    That‚Äôs also why I built the Petunia app ‚Äî to help owners track their dog‚Äôs vaccine schedule so they don‚Äôt show up out-of-date.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üöÄ Section 8: Rockets Don‚Äôt Wait ‚Äî Emergency &amp; Off-Schedule Visits</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Routine wellness is great ‚Äî but emergencies don‚Äôt care about your calendar.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    I remind clients: if your dog is vomiting, collapsing, struggling to breathe, or seems suddenly unwell, call your vet or emergency clinic <strong>immediately</strong>. Don‚Äôt wait for the next checkup.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    I‚Äôve seen it happen post-boarding ‚Äî sudden limps, skin issues, behavioral changes. Often, these need quick action. It‚Äôs better to be safe and wrong than too late.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">üì± Section 9: The Petunia App ‚Äî Health Reminders That Matter</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    One of the reasons I created the Petunia app was because of how often missed vaccines disrupted boarding plans.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Petunia helps pet parents track:

                    <li>Senior dog screenings (labs, X-rays)</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    It‚Äôs not a vet replacement. It‚Äôs just a simple way to stay organized ‚Äî and avoid last-minute cancellations or health issues that catch people off guard.
