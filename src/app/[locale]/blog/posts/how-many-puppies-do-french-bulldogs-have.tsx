          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Most French Bulldogs have small litters‚Äîcommonly 2‚Äì4 puppies</strong>, with outliers in either direction. Litter size
            depends on dam age/health, breeding timing, genetics, and semen quality. Because of their conformation, <strong>Frenchies
            have above-average rates of assisted delivery (C-section)</strong>. Responsible planning centers the dam‚Äôs health, uses precise
            ovulation timing, and prepares for surgical delivery when indicated. If you‚Äôre a pet owner (not a breeder), talk with your
            veterinarian about spay/neuter and long-term health planning.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> If your household is supporting a pregnant or postpartum Frenchie, store the <em>whelping plan</em>,
            <em> vet contacts</em>, <em>temperature targets</em>, and <em>neonatal weights</em> in Petunia. In an emergency, everyone reads the same
            instructions: who to call, what to bring, and where to go.

        {/* TYPICAL LITTER SIZE */}
        <section id="typical" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Typical Litter Size for French Bulldogs</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            In small, brachycephalic breeds like the French Bulldog, litters are usually on the <strong>small side (about 2‚Äì4 puppies)</strong>.
            Larger or smaller litters occur, but expecting four, three, or even two puppies is common. This pattern fits what veterinary
            reproduction data show across small breeds: smaller frames and certain conformations are associated with reduced litter size
            relative to larger, mesocephalic breeds.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Why does this matter? Litter size isn‚Äôt just a curiosity‚Äîit influences nutrition during pregnancy, risk of dystocia (trouble
            whelping), neonatal workloads, veterinary planning, and costs. Smaller litters can paradoxically raise dystocia risk
            (e.g., <em>singleton pups</em> that fail to trigger labor or are too large for the maternal pelvis), while very large litters
            raise maternal depletion risk and neonatal competition. Frenchies more often face the former problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your veterinarian confirms pregnancy, they can estimate litter size with <strong>ultrasound</strong> (best for viability, rough counts)
            and later with <strong>radiographs</strong> (~day 55+ from ovulation) to count skulls/spines‚Äîuseful for delivery planning and to ensure
            no puppy is retained after whelping or surgery.
          </p>

        <section id="why-varies" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Litter Size Varies: The Big Levers</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Dam age and parity.</strong> Very young and older bitches tend to have smaller litters. Peak fertility generally
              occurs in early adult years; extremes carry higher pregnancy and whelping risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ovulation timing and breeding management.</strong> Accurate <em>progesterone timing</em> markedly improves conception
              rates and litter size. Mis-timed breedings (too early/late) yield smaller or no litters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Semen quality and method.</strong> Fresh natural breeding tends to yield higher conception and larger litters than
              frozen AI when timing is imperfect. With <em>frozen semen</em>, precision timing and intrauterine deposition matter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Genetics and inbreeding.</strong> Genetic diversity and selection against conformations linked to obstructed whelping
              support better reproductive outcomes over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dam size, body condition, and health.</strong> Obesity, metabolic disease, and systemic illness reduce fertility
              and litter size. Lean, conditioned dams with complete health screening do better.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Environmental and husbandry factors.</strong> Heat stress, chronic stress, poor hygiene, and parasitism
              negatively affect fertility and neonatal survival.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Operator mindset:</strong> Don‚Äôt ‚Äúhope‚Äù your timing was right‚Äî<em>measure</em> it. Consistent progesterone curves and a
            defined breeding plan are the difference between viable litters and costly near-misses.

        {/* FRENCHIE-SPECIFIC FACTORS */}
        <section id="frenchie-factors" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frenchie-Specific Factors: Why This Breed Is Different</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            French Bulldogs are <strong>brachycephalic</strong> (short-muzzled) with comparatively broad shoulders and large heads relative to
            pelvic diameter. This shape predisposes many to <strong>cephalopelvic disproportion</strong>, making <em>assisted delivery (C-section)</em> more
            likely than in many other breeds. Frenchies also have higher-than-average risks for <strong>airway challenges (BOAS)</strong>, which affects
            anesthetic planning and perioperative care if a C-section is performed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            These anatomical realities do not automatically mandate surgery for every dam, but they do shift planning toward readiness:
            facilities with experienced anesthesia teams, oxygenation/temperature support, neonatal resuscitation supplies, and rapid
            access to emergency care. Many responsible breeders use <strong>scheduled C-sections</strong> based on ovulation timing and fetal maturity
            assessment to reduce the chance of emergent dystocia, fetal distress, and maternal fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, this is why Frenchie litters skew small: the same conformations that make whelping harder are also linked to
            smaller average litter sizes across populations of small brachycephalic breeds.

          <p className="mb-3">
            If you are considering breeding, set the bar high. Ethical breeding programs prioritize the dam‚Äôs health and temperament,
            select mates to <strong>improve airway function, mobility, and overall welfare</strong>, and avoid extreme features. Work closely with a
            reproduction-experienced veterinarian and follow club/registry guidance on <strong>health testing</strong> (e.g., airway grading, patellas,
            hips, eyes, cardiac; spinal screening as advised). Good programs limit the number of lifetime litters and space pregnancies
            to allow full recovery, with the dam‚Äôs long-term well-being as the controlling objective.

            (estrus), which is best identified with serial <strong>progesterone testing</strong> and, when needed, vaginal cytology. Because Frenchies
            often rely on AI or assisted breeding, precise timing is even more important: it affects <em>conception</em>, <em>litter size</em>, and <em>whelping date</em>.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Singleton litters</strong> (one puppy) can present unique challenges. The single fetus may grow larger, raising the risk of
            obstructed labor. Hormonal signals that coordinate the onset of labor may be weaker with only one fetus, predisposing to

            Behaviorally, singletons can miss out on littermate feedback. Skilled breeders add <em>structured socialization</em> with gentle,

            Nutritionally, singletons may overeat if milk supply is robust. Monitor weights to ensure <em>steady, not explosive</em> gain and
            adjust nursing rotations if needed.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Postpartum Frenchies need quiet, climate control, hydration, and careful monitoring. For C-section dams, incision checks,
            temperature, and appetite are the big three. For all dams, watch for <strong>metritis (uterine infection)</strong>, <strong>eclampsia (low calcium)</strong>,
            and <strong>mastitis</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Call your veterinarian urgently for the dam if you see:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">

          <p className="mb-3">
            Small litter size doesn‚Äôt mean small costs. Repro consults, progesterone testing, imaging, supplies, emergency fees,
            and potential C-section costs add up quickly. Responsible programs budget for <strong>complications</strong> and prioritize the dam‚Äôs
            well-being over litter size or sale price.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Progesterone timing (serial tests), AI procedures when applicable.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            For pet owners who are not breeding, discuss <strong>spay timing</strong> with your veterinarian to balance orthopedic, oncologic,
            and reproductive-tract health considerations while preventing unplanned pregnancies and pyometra risk later in life.

        <section id="faq" className="mb-16">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How many puppies do French Bulldogs usually have?</strong><br />
            Most litters are <strong>small‚Äîcommonly 2‚Äì4 puppies</strong>. Outliers occur, but Frenchies trend toward the lower end among purebred dogs.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Why are Frenchie litters small?</strong><br />
            Small body size, brachycephalic conformation, and the breed‚Äôs reproductive history all play roles. Timing, semen quality,
            and dam health further shape litter size.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do French Bulldogs need C-sections?</strong><br />
            Not universally, but <strong>assisted deliveries are more common</strong> in this breed. Many breeders plan C-sections based on ovulation
            timing and fetal maturity to reduce emergencies.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What is a singleton litter and is it risky?</strong><br />
            A <strong>singleton</strong> is a litter of one puppy. In Frenchies, singletons raise the risk of obstructed labor and may warrant a planned
            C-section. Socialization planning is important after birth.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How long are French Bulldogs pregnant?</strong><br />
            About <strong>63 days from ovulation</strong>. If you time from the first mating (instead of ovulation), apparent ‚Äúdue dates‚Äù can shift several days.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Should pet owners breed their Frenchie?</strong><br />
            Breeding is <strong>high-risk and resource-intensive</strong> in this breed. If you‚Äôre not prepared with veterinary partners, emergency funds,
            and neonatal capacity, discuss spay timing and long-term health planning with your veterinarian instead.
