          <p className="mb-4">
            Cane Corsos are <strong>active in a deliberate way</strong>: they need <strong>daily movement</strong>, <strong>consistent training</strong>, and <strong>regular mental work</strong>, but rarely
            thrive on chaotic, high-arousal play. Think <em>steady walks, strength basics, scent games, and public neutrality</em>, not endless fetch or dog-park
            brawls. The best outcomes come from <strong>lean body condition</strong>, <strong>structured routines</strong>, and <strong>calm leadership</strong>. With those pieces in place, most Corsos
            fit well into active families who enjoy purposeful exercise and quiet evenings.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> In Petunia, create a weekly rhythm card: two calm walks daily, one short skills block, two strength days, and three
            enrichment sessions. Assign owners and teens specific roles so the plan actually happens.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Movement needs:</strong> 60–90 minutes of <em>purposeful</em> activity across the day for healthy adults, split into calm walks and short skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind work:</strong> daily problem solving beats sprinting. Ten minutes of scent or training is real exercise for the brain.</li>
            <li><strong>Arousal control:</strong> neutrality around people and dogs is a core sport; teach the dog to ignore rather than engage.</li>
            <li><strong>Surfaces matter:</strong> traction over speed. Avoid repetitive ball-chasing on slick floors or sharp turns that stress joints.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> steady routines, quality sleep, and lean weight protect joints more than weekend marathons ever will.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Corsos are capable athletes when conditioned, but their superpower is <strong>self-possession under control</strong>. You build that with predictable,
            repeatable habits—little things done daily.

        <section id="energy-curve" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Energy Curve by Life Stage: Puppies → Seniors</h2>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Puppies (0–6 months)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Growth plates are open, coordination is developing, and attention spans are short. Activity looks like <strong>short, frequent</strong> outings:
            potty walks, sniffy exploration, and two- to three-minute training bursts. Choose large-breed puppy nutrition or appropriate all-life-stage
            diets to support steady, <strong>lean</strong> growth. Avoid stairs sprints and repetitive jumping; your goal is movement literacy, not miles.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Juveniles (6–18 months)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Adolescence brings size without full judgment. Increase walk duration gradually, add simple strength (sit-to-stand, balance stands), and
            practice neutrality in public. Expect arousal spikes and protect success with <strong>management</strong>: long line outdoors, gate the front door, and coach
            visitors to ignore the dog initially. This is when habits stick, good or bad.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Young Adults (18 months–~5 years)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            The athletic window. Build a <strong>two-walk plus one skill-block</strong> day. Add varied surfaces and gentle hills. Corsos do well with scent games,
            tracking-style searches, and calm strength patterns two to three times weekly. Keep arousal low; <em>think quiet competence</em> over chaos.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Mature Adults (~5–8 years)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Maintain fitness with a little more recovery. Keep nails short, add warm-ups and cool-downs, and watch for subtle lameness. Adjust volume
            before pain forces long rest. Dental care and body condition vigilance pay outsized dividends now.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Seniors (8+ years)</h3>
          <p>
            Shorter, more frequent walks, predictable schedules, traction runners at home, ramps for car and sofa, and strength micro-sessions keep
            mobility high. Enrichment shifts toward scent, puzzle feeding, and calm social time. Twice-yearly vet visits help tune the plan.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Healthy adult Corsos commonly thrive on <strong>60–90 minutes</strong> of total movement per day, split into pieces. That does not mean sprinting or high
            arousal. It means <strong>steady walks</strong>, <strong>small skill blocks</strong>, and <strong>planned recovery</strong>. Puppies and seniors need far less volume but benefit from
            frequent, gentle motion and brain work. Always scale based on weather, surfaces, and your dog&#39;s individual temperament and health.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">A practical daily template</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Morning:</strong> 15–30 minute sniff walk + 3–5 minute skills (hand targets, leash mechanics, settle on a mat).</li>
            <li><strong>Midday:</strong> 5–8 minute enrichment: scatter sniff, cardboard rip &amp; forage, frozen lick mat, or simple scent box search.</li>
            <li><strong>Evening:</strong> 20–40 minute calm walk or light hike + 5-minute strength block (sit-to-stand sets, balance stand, diagonal leg lifts).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Strength basics (2–3 days/week)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Sit-to-stand:</strong> 3 sets of 5 with perfect form.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance stand:</strong> 3 holds of 10–20 seconds; reward calm stillness.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookie stretches:</strong> nose to shoulder/hip; slow and symmetric.</li>
            <li><strong>Cavaletti poles:</strong> low height, slow pace, both directions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Warm up with three to five minutes of easy walking. Cool down the same. Avoid repetitive fetch on slick surfaces or hard, tight turns.
            The point is durability, not exhaustion.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm mt-3">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Log distance, duration, and a 1–5 excitement score for each outing. You will notice that lower-arousal sessions often
            produce calmer evenings and better learning next day.

        <section id="mental" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Mental Stimulation &amp; Enrichment: Work the Brain</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            For guardian breeds, thinking work matters as much as steps. Ten minutes of <strong>nosework</strong> can settle a Corso better than a 40-minute game
            of fetch. Rotate low-cost games and keep difficulty just above baseline so your dog wins with effort.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Rotation ideas</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Find-it scatter:</strong> toss kibble into short grass; release to search.</li>
            <li><strong>Box searches:</strong> hide food in one of three boxes; shuffle and let the dog solve.</li>
            <li><strong>Sniff trails:</strong> drag a treat-filled sock for 20 feet; lay turns; release to track.</li>
            <li><strong>Lick mats &amp; chews:</strong> spread thinned food on a mat or offer a safe chew for decompression.</li>
            <li><strong>Trick micro-sessions:</strong> chin rest, paw target, bow, spin—two minutes counts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Finish enrichment with a short <strong>settle</strong> on a mat to let the nervous system downshift. Over time, this pattern builds a dog who can
            flip between activity and rest on cue.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Socialization & neutrality */}
        <section id="socialization" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Socialization &amp; Public Neutrality at All Ages</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            For a guardian breed, socialization does not mean greeting every person and dog. It means <strong>calm exposure without obligation</strong>.
            Puppy&#39;s first year should include quiet observation of strollers, wheelchairs, kids playing, hats and hoods, umbrellas, traffic, and polite
            ignoring of strangers. The dog learns that these are background, not problems to fix.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Rules of thumb</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Expose at a distance where your dog stays <strong>under threshold</strong> and can earn rewards for disengaging.</li>
            <li>Use a <strong>long line</strong> for freedom without chaos; reward check-ins.</li>
            <li>End sessions early while success is high. Wins build confidence faster than white-knuckled endurance.</li>
            <li>Teach &quot;look at that&quot;: mark the glance at a trigger, then reward returning attention.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Track a weekly exposure list in Petunia with a 1–5 calm score and the distance where neutrality holds. Progress is
            measured in calm seconds and shorter distances over time.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Corsos are very trainable but not forgiving of fuzzy rules. The right approach is <strong>calm, reward-based training</strong> paired with consistent
            boundaries. Avoid both harshness and permissiveness. Think <em>matter-of-fact leadership</em>.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Core family skills</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Leash mechanics: heel at the thigh, automatic sit at curbs, default attention cue.</li>
            <li>Place/settle: go to mat and relax while life happens.</li>
            <li>Door protocol: leash on before door opens; guests ignore initially; optional greeting on cue.</li>
            <li>Out/drop: easy release of toys and food bowls; prevents resource guarding.</li>
            <li>Recall: cheerful &quot;come&quot; that works when arousal rises.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            The single biggest longevity lever is <strong>body condition</strong>. Lean dogs live longer and move more comfortably across breeds. Feed a complete
            diet that meets AAFCO or FEDIAF profiles for your dog&#39;s life stage. Measure meals to calories, not scoops, and re-check portions every two
            weeks based on weight and a 9-point body condition score target of 4–5.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Corsos carry mass on big joints. The most powerful joint protector is a <strong>lean physique</strong>, followed by smart surfaces and controlled patterns.
            Supplements can help some individuals, especially combined with weight control and exercise.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Common options to discuss with your veterinarian</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA):</strong> joint and skin support; dose and product quality matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Glucosamine/chondroitin/green-lipped mussel:</strong> widely used for joint comfort in some dogs.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid, collagen, or undenatured type-II collagen:</strong> emerging adjuncts for joint support.</li>
            <li><strong>Joint-friendly pain plans:</strong> your vet may recommend anti-inflammatories or rehab programs when indicated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supplements are not a substitute for management. Keep nails short, use traction runners at home, avoid slippery fetch, and warm up
            before activity. Small daily habits preserve mobility.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Large, dark-coated dogs can overheat quickly. In hot months, shift walks to dawn and dusk, favor shade and water breaks, and monitor

            Many Corsos live peacefully with other animals when introductions are structured. Feed separately, store chews when dogs are
            together, and teach turn-taking during affection. In public, prioritize <strong>neutrality</strong> over mingling. Parallel walks with known dogs beat
            chaotic dog-park scenes for this breed.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Corsos often prefer <strong>small groups</strong>, <strong>short play sets</strong>, and <strong>structured sniff walks</strong> over all-day free-for-all play. When evaluating care:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Ask about staff-to-dog ratios, play style matching, and rest schedules.</li>
            <li>Look for traction surfaces, ramps, and careful introductions.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Are Cane Corsos high-energy dogs?</strong><br />
            They are <em>steady-energy</em> dogs. Most need consistent movement and mental work but do best with lower arousal and clear routines. Think hikers,
            walkers, and backyard sniffers—not endless ball machines.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How many miles should a healthy adult Corso walk?</strong><br />
            There is no single number. Many adults thrive on 60–90 minutes of total movement split into sessions, scaled to weather and surfaces. Quality of
            movement and neutrality matter more than absolute distance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is a dog park a good outlet?</strong><br />
            Usually not. Most Corsos prefer known companions, parallel walks, and structured play with rests. Dog-park chaos creates arousal and friction.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Which joint supplements are worth trying?</strong><br />
            Discuss omega-3s from marine sources, glucosamine/chondroitin or green-lipped mussel, and other adjuncts with your veterinarian. Weight control
            and surfaces will beat any pill if you must choose one thing.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What is the single best habit to add this week?</strong><br />
            Photograph portions, measure meals to calories, and add one five-minute skill block per day. You will see calmer behavior within a week.
