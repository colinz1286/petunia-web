          Ethical, skilled breeding is not a vibe or a marketing page‚Äîit is a disciplined workflow
          you can <em>show</em>. The strongest breeders we know treat questions from potential
          clients as an invitation to demonstrate planning, documentation, veterinary collaboration,
          and long-term commitment to the dogs they produce. This article lays out a practical,
          evidence-informed foundation of questions responsible breeders should be ready to answer
          (and prove) before placing puppies. It is not exhaustive; it is a solid base you can adapt
          to your breed, country, and veterinary guidance.

        <p className="mb-4">
          For buyers, use this as a conversation map. For breeders, treat it as a quality-control
          checklist. For both, remember that local law, your primary veterinarian, and your breed
          club&rsquo;s published testing scheme outrank any generalized internet advice.

        {/* SECTION 1: ETHOS & LIFETIME COMMITMENT */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">1) Ethos, Code of Ethics &amp; Lifetime Commitment</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>What guiding code of ethics or breeder standards do you follow?</li>
          <li>Do you take back or help rehome your dogs at any age if a buyer&rsquo;s situation changes?</li>
          <li>How do you screen buyers‚Äîand what placements will you decline?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Good breeders are custodians of a bloodline and of canine welfare. A written ethos and a
          lifetime take-back policy reduce shelter intakes and protect dogs from being sold on
          classifieds. Screening buyers (housing, work schedules, expectations, prior dog
          experience, budget for veterinary care, temperament fit) is a welfare tool, not gatekeeping.
          Reputable registries and veterinary organizations explicitly promote ethics, education, and
          buyer counseling as part of responsible breeding.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Good Looks Like</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            A concise <strong>breeder statement</strong> or code of ethics aligned with reputable
            bodies (e.g., national kennel clubs, veterinary guidance) and breed-club testing lists.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>take-back/rehoming clause</strong> in the sales contract that applies for the
            dog&rsquo;s lifetime and is actually honored in practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            A written <strong>screening process</strong> (application, interview, references) and
            clear criteria for declining a placement‚Äîplus help for the buyer to prepare for a future
            puppy if now is not the right time.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* SECTION 2: HEALTH TESTING & DOCUMENTATION */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">2) Health Testing: Orthopedic, Cardiac, Ophthalmic &amp; DNA</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>What <strong>orthopedic</strong> screenings (hips, elbows) do the sire and dam have?</li>
          <li>What <strong>eye</strong> (ophthalmic) and <strong>cardiac</strong> certifications are current?</li>
          <li>Which <strong>breed-specific DNA tests</strong> were run (e.g., PRA variants, DM, MDR1, breed-relevant conditions)?</li>
          <li>Do you use <strong>PennHIP</strong> (with DI values and percentile) or OFA/BVA for hips?</li>
          <li>Can I see <strong>proof</strong>‚Äîofficial certificate numbers, links to public databases, and dates?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Orthopedic dysplasias and inherited conditions vary by breed. High-quality programs follow
          the breed club&rsquo;s testing scheme and publish results (OFA/CHIC in the U.S.; BVA/KC in
          the UK; FCI equivalents elsewhere). PennHIP measures passive hip laxity and reports a
          distraction index (lower is better) with breed percentile‚Äîuseful for selection. DNA tests
          are not a substitute for phenotypic screens (e.g., hip radiographs, auscultation/echo,
          ophthalmology exams), but they help avoid risk matings when variants are known. Buyers do
          not need a genomics lecture; they need proof the parents were screened and that those
          results informed mating decisions.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Good Looks Like</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Certificates in a single folder</strong> (PDFs or printed) with easy-to-read
            summaries: OFA or BVA/KC numbers, dates, results, links to public listings, DNA panel
            results with variant statuses, ophthalmology (CAER), cardiac clearances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breed-specific plan</strong> referencing the CHIC or breed-club testing list (for
            example: hips, elbows, eyes annually, cardiac, and named DNA tests). Note any tests not
            relevant to your line and why.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Context talk</strong>: not just &ldquo;we tested&rdquo; but how results shaped
            the mating (e.g., avoiding carrier-to-carrier; preferring lower PennHIP DI; choosing
            mates with complementary strengths).
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* SECTION 3: INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">3) Infectious-Disease Control (with <em>Brucella canis</em>)</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>Do you screen breeding stock for <em>Brucella canis</em> before mating or import?</li>
          <li>What quarantine, sanitation, and visitor policies protect neonates and dams?</li>
          <li>
            How do you manage vaccination timing for dams and puppies, and how are high-risk
            exposures (parks, shows, pet-store floors) avoided until the series is underway?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>Brucella canis</em> compromises fertility, causes abortion, and poses a zoonotic risk
          to people. Responsible programs test new additions, screen prior to mating, and follow
          their veterinarian&rsquo;s protocols for isolation if there is any suspect result.
          Neonates are immunologically vulnerable; hygiene, limited traffic, and clean whelping
          spaces reduce pathogen load. Vaccine timing and deworming are coordinated with the
          veterinarian and documented for buyers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Good Looks Like</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Recent <em>Brucella canis</em> test results</strong> for sire/dam from a
            reputable lab, with your vet&rsquo;s sign-off.
          </li>
          <li>
            A short <strong>biosecurity SOP</strong> (handwashing, footwear policy, visitor limits,
            how you sanitize whelping boxes, when puppies first meet vetted adult dogs).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vaccine/deworming plan</strong> on a timeline (what the dam received pre-breeding,
            what the puppies receive and when).
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* SECTION 4: PREGNANCY, WHELPING & NEONATAL CARE */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">4) Pregnancy, Whelping &amp; Neonatal Care</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>How do you confirm pregnancy and monitor dam health (nutrition, weight, calcium strategy)?</li>
          <li>What is your whelping plan (who attends, 24/7 observation, emergency vet on call)?</li>
          <li>Do you record birth weights, colostrum intake, and growth curves for each puppy?</li>
          <li>How do you prevent fading puppy syndrome and manage weak neonates?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whelping is medical and logistical, not just sentimental. Weight charts detect failure to
          thrive. Backup colostrum/milk replacer planning matters. Calcium management reduces
          eclampsia risk. Temperature, humidity, and sanitation affect survival. A breeder who has a
          veterinary relationship and a written plan for complications is protecting both dam and
          litter.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Good Looks Like</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">

          <li>
            <strong>Daily weight charts</strong> for each puppy; notes on nursing, supplementation,
            and milestone checks (eyes/ears opening, thermoregulation, early elimination).
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>post-partum plan</strong> for the dam (nutrition, mastitis watch, uterine

        {/* SECTION 5: EARLY SOCIALIZATION & RAISING PUPPIES */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">5) Early Socialization, Behavior &amp; Rearing Protocols</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>How do you socialize puppies before homing? What do their days look like from weeks 3‚Äì8+</li>
          <li>Do you introduce crate time, short car rides, novel surfaces and sounds, and handling?</li>
          <li>What temperament observations do you track, and how do you match puppies to homes?</li>
          <li>Do you start house-training habits and basic name/recall foundations?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The socialization period (roughly 3‚Äì14 weeks) is uniquely sensitive. Early, controlled,
          positive exposures reduce fear later in life. Puppies raised with intentional handling,
          surfaces, sounds, and short separations tend to transition more smoothly to their homes.
          A breeder&rsquo;s daily routine shapes attention, startle recovery, and human trust long
          before a trainer ever meets the dog.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Good Looks Like</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            A <strong>weekly plan</strong> of exposures: gentle handling, different textures, sound
            desensitization, car rides, calm visits outdoors (low-risk spaces), supervised meets with
            known, vaccinated adult dogs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Short crate sessions</strong> paired with chews; quiet-reward rules at night.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>House-training starts</strong>: predictable feeding, out-the-same-door, praise
            after elimination, enzyme cleanup for accidents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Observations log</strong> (individual notes rather than one-day &ldquo;tests&rdquo;),

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Consistent, veterinarian-guided vaccination reduces parvo and distemper risk; deworming and
          fecal checks address common intestinal parasites. Microchipping improves return-to-owner
          rates if a dog is lost. Clear records reduce missed boosters and help the buyer&rsquo;s vet
          continue care seamlessly.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">7) Genetic Diversity, COI &amp; (Where Available) EBVs</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>Do you track inbreeding (COI) in matings? What tools or registries do you use?</li>
          <li>In countries offering <strong>Estimated Breeding Values</strong> (EBVs) for hips/elbows, do you use them?</li>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Concentrating genes can lock in excellence‚Äîand risk. Tracking COI and using mate-selection
          tools help reduce the chance of pairing carriers or shrinking the gene pool. Where EBVs are
          supported (e.g., The Kennel Club in the UK), they provide data-driven hip/elbow risk
          predictions beyond a single dog&rsquo;s score. Transparency about how diversity is managed
          shows buyers you are thinking beyond one litter.

        <p className="mb-4">
          A calm, curious, biddable dog is a safer, happier family member. Breeding decisions should

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>What does your sales contract include (identity, microchip, limited vs. full registration)?</li>
          <li>What health warranty do you provide, and how does it interact with state/provincial pet-purchase laws?</li>
          <li>What are your spay/neuter or breeding-rights terms? Do you require co-ownerships?</li>
          <li>Do you guarantee to take the dog back if the buyer cannot keep them?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Clear contracts protect both parties and the dog. Many jurisdictions have pet-purchase
          protection (&ldquo;lemon&rdquo;) laws that set minimum remedies. A warranty should never
          limit statutory rights. Spay/neuter timing and breeding-rights decisions are medical and
          ethical choices; they warrant individualized discussion with the buyer&rsquo;s veterinarian.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Good Looks Like</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            A <strong>plain-language contract</strong> reviewed by counsel and aligned with local
            law, with microchip number, buyer and seller info, and disclosures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Warranty terms</strong> that complement, not reduce, statutory remedies; clear
            process for veterinary diagnosis and remedy (refund/replacement/medical contribution).
          </li>
          <li>
            Thoughtful <strong>spay/neuter guidance</strong> that references veterinary counsel and
            breed considerations; ethical, sparing use of co-ownerships.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* SECTION 10: TRANSPARENCY ABOUT LIMITS & TRADEOFFS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">10) Transparency About Limits, Tradeoffs &amp; Known Risks</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>What health risks are known in this breed/line, and how are you mitigating them?</li>
          <li>What traits are you still working to improve‚Äîand how?</li>
          <li>What support do you offer if medical or behavioral issues appear?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No line is perfect. Honesty builds trust. Sharing OFA breed-statistics links, discussing
          the limits of DNA panels, acknowledging orthopedic or temperament risks, and explaining how
          you weigh mates shows the buyer you are not selling a fantasy‚Äîyou are managing a living
          population with intention.

            Links to <strong>breed statistics</strong> (hips, elbows, congenital issues) and a
            simple paragraph on how your program responds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>After-sale support</strong>: response times, vet referrals, training resources,

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Buyer Questions</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>At what age do puppies go home, and why? Do littermates ever stay longer for observation?</li>
          <li>How do you handle shipping or ground transport‚Äîif at all?</li>
          <li>What starter kit, instructions, and check-ins do you provide after placement?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most jurisdictions and veterinarians advise homing around eight weeks, when puppies have
          had foundational socialization with dam and litter but are ready to bond to people. Some
          breeds or individuals benefit from a few extra weeks (confidence, bite inhibition).
          Ethical transport minimizes stress and disease risk. Early check-ins reduce preventable
          problems during the transition week.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">

            A <strong>go-home packet</strong>: veterinary records, microchip, feeding plan, crate

          </li>
          <li>

          A responsible breeder&rsquo;s job does not end at placement; a buyer&rsquo;s job begins.
          Before pickup, read your vet&rsquo;s vaccine schedule plan, understand safe early
          socialization (controlled exposures before the series is complete), and prepare a boredom-proof
          house: crate, pen, enzyme cleaner, safe chews, training treats, and a short daily schedule.
          Choose a local veterinary clinic, enroll in a vet-verified puppy class, and plan a humane
          training approach anchored in clarity and consistency rather than intimidation.

        {/* KEY TAKEAWAYS */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-10">
          <li>
            Responsible breeders welcome questions and answer with <strong>evidence</strong>‚Äîtest
            numbers, veterinary letters, logs, and clear policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Health testing is <strong>multi-modal</strong>: orthopedic imaging, eye/cardiac exams,
            breed-specific DNA panels, and infectious-disease screening.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early socialization and rearing routines are daily work, not a weekend photoshoot; they
            shape adult behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contracts and laws exist to protect the dog and both parties; clarity and fairness are
            part of ethics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversity management (COI, EBV where offered) and long-term planning prove that a program
            thinks beyond a single litter.
          </li>
