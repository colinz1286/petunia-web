          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Dachshunds are famous for their long bodies and short legs, but this unique build makes them prone to back problems—especially intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Owners can reduce risk through weight management, safe handling, ramps instead of stairs, and regular veterinary checkups. Treatments range from rest and medication to surgery. With the right care, many Dachshunds with IVDD live long, happy lives.

        <section id="why" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Dachshunds Are Prone to Back Problems</h2>
          <p>
            Dachshunds were originally bred for hunting badgers, requiring a long, flexible body to enter tunnels. Unfortunately, this conformation increases stress on the spine. Their short legs offer little support against the strain placed on their elongated back. Over 20–25% of Dachshunds are estimated to develop serious back problems during their lifetime.

        <section id="ivdd" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)</h2>
          <p>
            The most common back problem in Dachshunds is intervertebral disc disease. In IVDD, the cushioning discs between vertebrae deteriorate or rupture, pressing on the spinal cord. This can cause pain, loss of coordination, or even paralysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two main types:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Type I:</strong> Disc rupture, often sudden and severe; common in younger Dachshunds (ages 3–7).</li>
            <li><strong>Type II:</strong> Slower, degenerative disc changes; more common in older dogs.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="symptoms" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Symptoms Owners Should Watch For</h2>
          <p>
            Back problems can appear suddenly or gradually. Warning signs include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Reluctance to jump, climb stairs, or play</li>
            <li>Yelping when picked up or touched</li>
            <li>Unsteady gait or dragging legs</li>
            <li>Loss of bladder or bowel control</li>
            <li>Paralysis in severe cases</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Any sudden mobility loss in a Dachshund is a veterinary emergency and requires immediate attention.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Prevention Strategies</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Extra pounds strain the spine.</li>
            <li><strong>Use ramps:</strong> Replace stairs and furniture jumps with ramps.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe handling:</strong> Always support both the chest and hindquarters when lifting.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular low-impact activity strengthens muscles without stressing the back.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid rough play:</strong> Discourage jumping from heights or wrestling with larger dogs.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="treatment" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Treatment and Recovery Options</h2>
          <p>
            Treatment depends on severity:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Mild cases:</strong> Strict rest, anti-inflammatory medication, and physical therapy.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate cases:</strong> Laser therapy, acupuncture, or rehabilitation programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Severe cases:</strong> Surgery to relieve spinal cord pressure, followed by rehabilitation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Prognosis varies: dogs treated quickly after symptoms appear often recover well, but delays can lead to permanent damage.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Long-Term Lifestyle Care</h2>
          <p>
            Dachshunds with back issues benefit from lifelong adjustments:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Keep them lean with portion control and a balanced diet</li>
            <li>Incorporate controlled exercise like walking or swimming</li>
            <li>Provide orthopedic bedding</li>
            <li>Use harnesses instead of collars to avoid neck strain</li>
            <li>Regular vet checkups for early detection of recurrence</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="boarding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boarding and Daycare Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Dachshunds in boarding or daycare need special handling. Staff should be trained to pick them up correctly and avoid activities that stress their back. Safe, low-impact playgroups are ideal. Owners should always disclose any history of IVDD so staff can monitor carefully.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Dachshunds bring joy with their quirky looks and affectionate personalities, but their long backs require extra care. By recognizing symptoms early, practicing preventive strategies, and working closely with veterinarians, owners can give their Dachshunds the best chance at a long, comfortable life. Awareness and proactive care are key to keeping these beloved dogs healthy and mobile.
