          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Border Collies can be wonderful family dogs—but only for households prepared to meet 
            their extremely high mental and physical needs. They are affectionate, loyal, and intelligent, 
            but require significant daily exercise, structure, and engagement. For active families, they are 
            exceptional companions; for low-activity homes, they may be overwhelming.
          </p>

        {/* Temperament Overview */}
        <section id="temperament" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Border Collie Temperament Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Border Collies are widely recognized as one of the most intelligent dog breeds in the world. 
            Originally bred for controlling livestock across rugged landscapes, they have sharp instincts, 
            high work drive, and unmatched problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>Their core temperament traits include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Extremely high intelligence</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Strong herding instincts</strong></li>
            <li><strong>High sensitivity</strong> to tone and body language</li>
            <li><strong>Strong desire for routine and purpose</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Affectionate and people-oriented</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These traits make them deeply bonded family dogs—but only when their needs are consistently met.
          </p>

        {/* Kids */}
        <section id="kids" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Are Border Collies Good With Kids?</h2>
          <p>
            Border Collies can be excellent with children when properly socialized. 
            They are patient, loyal, and eager to participate in family activities. However, 
            their natural herding instincts may lead them to “round up” running children by 
            circling, nudging, or nipping at heels.
          </p>
          <p>Families with kids should consider:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Teaching children calm, respectful interaction</li>
            <li>Monitoring playtime to prevent overstimulation</li>
            <li>Redirecting herding behaviors with training and structure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Structured engagement helps Border Collies thrive in homes with active, dog-savvy children.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* energy requirements */}
        <section id="energy" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Energy Levels & Daily Stimulation Needs</h2>
          <p>
            This is where most families underestimate the breed. Border Collies have some of the highest 
            energy levels of any dog, requiring <strong>both physical and mental exercise</strong> to stay balanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Daily goals often include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>1–2 hours of structured physical activity</li>
            <li>Daily obedience or agility training</li>
            <li>Scent work, puzzle toys, or problem-solving games</li>
            <li>Off-leash running in safe, controlled spaces</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mental fatigue is just as important as physical activity. Without it, Border Collies may 
            become vocal, destructive, or anxious.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* training */}
        <section id="training" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Training Requirements for Family Homes</h2>
          <p>
            Border Collies excel at training, but they also require it. Their intelligence can lead 
            to frustration or misbehavior if not given structure and purpose.
          </p>
          <p>Essential training foundations include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Reliable recall training—Border Collies love to chase movement</li>
            <li>Impulse control exercises</li>
            <li>Consistent daily routines</li>
            <li>Early socialization with children and other pets</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A well-trained Border Collie is a dream family dog. An under-trained one can be overwhelming.
          </p>

        {/* Behavior */}
        <section id="behavior" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Common Behavior Challenges in Family Environments</h2>
          <p>
            Border Collies are not naturally “easy” dogs. Their working heritage can lead to predictable 
            challenges in inexperienced families.
          </p>
          <p>Common issues include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Herding children or other pets</li>
            <li>Barking or howling when bored</li>
            <li>Destructive chewing when understimulated</li>
            <li>Chasing cars, bikes, or fast-moving objects</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many of these behaviors improve with proper exercise, training, and enrichment.

          <p>
            While Border Collies are generally healthy, prospective families should understand the 
            breed’s common medical concerns—particularly joint issues and genetic eye diseases.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Border Collies can be outstanding family dogs in the right environment. 
            They are loving, intelligent, and deeply loyal—but they truly flourish only when their 
            considerable mental and physical needs are met. For active, engaged families with time, 
            structure, and enthusiasm, Border Collies become extraordinary lifelong companions.
