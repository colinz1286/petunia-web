          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Short Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>There is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog.</strong> All dogs produce allergenic proteins, mainly from dander (skin),
            saliva, and urine. Some dogs <em>appear</em> to trigger fewer symptoms for some people because of coat type, grooming routines,
            and household cleaning, but <strong>no breed is guaranteed allergy-free</strong>. What you can control: pick dogs whose coats tend
            to retain loose hair, commit to consistent grooming, and run a layered home allergy plan. Then confirm your personal
            tolerance through real-world exposure.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Before committing, schedule multiple meetups with the same dog after exercise, play, and grooming.
            Log your symptoms, meds taken, and timing in Petunia to see trends rather than guesses.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What &ldquo;Hypoallergenic&rdquo; Actually Means</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            In consumer health, &ldquo;hypoallergenic&rdquo; means a product or organism is <em>less likely</em> to cause an allergic reaction,
            not that it is free of allergens. In the dog world, the word is used loosely to market low-shedding breeds or mixes as
            &ldquo;better for allergies.&rdquo; The problem is twofold: first, shedding is not the allergen; second, peer-reviewed studies
            have <strong>not</strong> found a breed that reliably produces less of the major dog allergens across real homes. That is why major
            allergy organizations advise that there is <strong>no</strong> truly hypoallergenic dog. The most honest framing is: some coats and
            routines <em>may</em> be easier for some people, but results are individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically, &ldquo;hypoallergenic&rdquo; should be treated as a <em>starting hypothesis</em> that requires confirmation through
            exposure and a home plan, not as a guarantee tied to a breed label.

        <section id="allergy-biology" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Allergy Biology: What You Are Actually Reacting To</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Dog allergy is an immune response to specific <strong>proteins</strong> collectively nicknamed <em>Can f</em> (for <em>Canis familiaris</em>).
            The best studied include <em>Can f 1</em> and <em>Can f 2</em> (lipocalins), <em>Can f 3</em> (serum albumin), and <em>Can f 5</em> (a prostatic
            kallikrein produced by intact males). These proteins ride on microscopic particles from skin and saliva; grooming, licking,
            and normal skin turnover deposit them into dust and onto surfaces. Because allergen particles can linger, people can react
            in dog-free spaces that still contain residual allergen in dust and fabrics.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            People also differ in which allergen components they react to. Some patients are primarily sensitized to <em>Can f 1</em>,
            others to <em>Can f 5</em>, and so on. That is one reason person A might tolerate a given dog that person B cannot.
            In select cases, component-resolved diagnostics with an allergy specialist can clarify what you react to and guide
            expectations for living with dogs.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> If allergies are significant in your household, ask your allergist about component-resolved testing
            (e.g., <em>Can f 1/2/3/5</em>). Knowing your personal pattern helps you design a smarter plan.

        {/* Myths */}
        <section id="myths" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Common Myths (&amp; the Reality)</h2>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Myth 1: &ldquo;Some breeds are truly hypoallergenic.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            No major allergy body endorses any specific dog breed as truly hypoallergenic. Studies that measured <em>Can f 1</em>
            in hair or homes did not find a dependable &ldquo;allergy-friendly&rdquo; set of breeds. Treat &ldquo;hypoallergenic&rdquo; as a
            marketing shortcut, not a scientific category.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Myth 2: &ldquo;If a dog does not shed, I will not react.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Shedding is a mechanical process; allergens are biological proteins. A low-shedding coat can <em>help</em> contain loose hair,
            but dander and saliva are still produced. You can react to a low-shedding dog, and you can sometimes tolerate a moderate-shedding
            dog if environmental control is excellent.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Myth 3: &ldquo;Hair vs fur&rdquo; determines allergy risk.</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Mammalian hair and fur are both keratin. What differs is <strong>growth cycle and structure</strong>. Coats that grow continuously
            may trap more shed hair until brushed or clipped; many double coats are engineered by nature to release undercoat seasonally.
            Neither option removes allergens entirely.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Myth 4: &ldquo;A list of &lsquo;hypoallergenic breeds&rsquo; is a guarantee.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Lists can be helpful as a <em>starting point</em> because certain coats are easier to manage. But individual variability, genetics,
            and house routines matter more. Always confirm with real-world exposure before you commit.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Myth 5: &ldquo;A single bath &amp; you are safe for weeks.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            Washing can temporarily lower recoverable allergen on hair, but the effect fades unless you repeat it and pair it with
            brushing and environmental cleaning. Think rhythms and layers, not one-time fixes.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="shedding-vs-allergens" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Shedding vs Allergens: Intertwined, Not Identical</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Shedding describes how much hair leaves the coat and falls into the environment; allergen load describes how much
            allergenic protein reaches your air and surfaces. A low-shedding dog can still distribute allergen through saliva
            (licking toys, bedding, and people) and microscopic dander. Conversely, households with routine grooming, excellent
            ventilation, HEPA filtration, and damp dusting can sometimes keep symptoms manageable even with a moderate shedder.
          </p>
          <p>
            This distinction explains why two families can have opposite experiences with the same breed: the dog, the people, and
            the environment all interact.

        {/* Genetics */}
        <section id="genetics" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Coat Genetics: Why One Dog Triggers You and Another Does Not</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Most visible coat differences map to a few genes. Three classics explain a lot of what you see: <strong>RSPO2</strong> (furnishings:
            beard/brows), <strong>FGF5</strong> (hair length), and <strong>KRT71</strong> (curl). Veterinary genetic testing also reports a shedding-related
            signal (<strong>MC5R</strong>) in many non-wire-haired breeds. Dogs with furnishings and curl often retain loose hair until brushed;
            flat &ldquo;improper&rdquo; coats without furnishings tend to release more hair into the environment. None of these remove allergens,
            but they influence how hair behaves in your home and how much daily brushing matters.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            For breeders, pairing furnished sires/dams and selecting for curl can shift a litter toward coats that are easier to maintain
            in allergy-aware homes. For buyers, seeing the actual genotype printouts (RSPO2, MC5R, sometimes KRT71 and FGF5) offers clearer
            expectations than a vague label like &ldquo;hypoallergenic.&rdquo;

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Ask for DNA coat test results for the parents and the specific puppy you are considering.

            Reminder up front: <strong>no breed is truly hypoallergenic</strong>. The breeds below are commonly recommended because they
            <em>tend</em> to be lower-shedding or have hair-type coats that retain loose hair until brushed or clipped. Your experience can
            still vary based on individual biology and your home routine. For each, we summarize size, general temperament, grooming

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Coat:</strong> Hairless varieties reduce shed hair but still produce dander and saliva; coated varieties have manageable hair-type coats.  
            <strong>Size:</strong> Toy to standard (Xolo); Chinese Crested is toy-sized.  
            <strong>Temperament:</strong> Companion-oriented, lively, often cuddly.  
            <strong>Exercise:</strong> Moderate; daily walks and play.  
            <strong>Grooming:</strong> Skin care for hairless dogs (sun protection, gentle bathing); brushing for coated varieties.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Fit snapshot:</strong> Consider if you want minimal shed hair but can commit to skin care and routine cleaning. Hairless

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How To Choose the Right Breed for <em>You</em></h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Your goal is not to find a magic &ldquo;hypoallergenic&rdquo; badge; it is to find the <strong>best real-world fit</strong> across energy, size,
            grooming bandwidth, training style, family dynamics, and your own allergy profile. Here is a practical framework:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Write your non-negotiables.</strong> Maximum adult size, daily exercise minutes, acceptable grooming time and budget,
              alone-time tolerance, kid compatibility. Be honest and specific (&ldquo;90 minutes daily exercise&rdquo; beats &ldquo;active&rdquo;).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shortlist 3–5 breeds</strong> (or mixes) whose coat and energy match your life. Use club standards and reputable sources, not
              generic lists. Note coat <em>maintenance</em>, not just shedding claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan exposure.</strong> Meet adults of those breeds in varied states: just groomed, post-walk, after play. Visit homes,
              parks, and reputable breeders. Track symptoms and context (indoors vs outdoors, carpet vs hard floors).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Layer a home plan.</strong> HEPA filtration, damp-dusting, vacuum with sealed HEPA, bedroom boundaries, washable dog bedding,
              frequent laundering, and a bathing/brushing schedule that suits your dog&rsquo;s coat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Re-test.</strong> Repeat exposure after you have your routine dialed in; some people adapt to a rhythm that reduces flares.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consider medical support.</strong> An allergist can discuss medications or (in selected cases) immunotherapy. Component-resolved
              testing helps set expectations when <em>Can f 5</em> or other targets are involved.
            </li>

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Build a shared &ldquo;Allergy Plan&rdquo; in Petunia: filter change dates, vacuum schedule, bath calendar,

          <p className="mb-3">
            Because allergens are proteins on particles, your best strategy is additive:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Ventilation &amp; filtration:</strong> Use a true HEPA air cleaner sized for the room. In central systems, consider MERV-13 filters if your unit supports them.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleaning cadence:</strong> Vacuum carpets and upholstery with a sealed HEPA vacuum; damp-dust hard surfaces; launder dog bedding weekly and crate pads frequently.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathing &amp; brushing:</strong> Regular, gentle bathing plus thorough line brushing and a metal comb to skin. Frequency depends on coat type and your allergist&rsquo;s advice.</li>
            <li><strong>Zone management:</strong> Keep bedrooms low-allergen; use washable throws on sofas; limit face licking if saliva is a trigger.</li>
            <li><strong>Grooming logistics:</strong> After pro grooms or blow-outs, air out rooms, vacuum, and wipe surfaces to capture disturbed particles.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each step helps a little; together they help a lot. The &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; plan is the one your family can repeat without fail.

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Confirm expectations:</strong> &ldquo;Hypoallergenic&rdquo; is not a guarantee. Ask for honest shedding demos (brush on a dark towel).</li>
            <li><strong>See DNA coat results:</strong> RSPO2 (furnishings) and, where available, MC5R (shedding), plus KRT71 (curl) and FGF5 (length) if offered.</li>
            <li><strong>Meet adults:</strong> Meet a parent and unrelated adults from the line. Puppies can mislead on coat and energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Get a grooming SOP:</strong> Tools, frequency, and sample calendar. Ask for a &ldquo;first 90 days&rdquo; schedule you can follow.</li>
            <li><strong>Trial exposure:</strong> Arrange multiple visits or a structured foster/trial if the breeder or rescue allows. Log symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Health &amp; ethics:</strong> Verify health testing (hips/elbows where relevant), vaccination/deworming, contract clarity, and support.</li>

        {/* FAQ */}
        <section id="faq" className="mb-16">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is there any breed that is truly hypoallergenic?</strong><br />
            No. Major allergy organizations and peer-reviewed studies agree that no dog breed is allergen-free. Some breeds may be
            easier to live with for some people, but results vary person to person.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Why do some people tolerate one dog but react to another?</strong><br />
            Individual sensitization patterns differ (for example, <em>Can f 5</em> vs <em>Can f 1</em>), and environments differ (carpets, ventilation,
            cleaning cadence). Coat type and grooming also change how hair and dander behave in your home.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do hairless dogs solve allergies?</strong><br />
            Hairless coats reduce shed hair, but dander and saliva allergens remain. Skin care and routine cleaning still matter.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Will one bath fix things for weeks?</strong><br />
            Bathing can temporarily lower recoverable allergen on hair, but you must repeat it and pair it with environmental cleaning
            for sustained benefit.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Should I do allergy testing before getting a dog?</strong><br />
            If you have a history of significant symptoms, yes—speak with an allergist. Component-resolved diagnostics can clarify
            what you react to and help you design a plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Is there a best first dog for kids with mild allergies?</strong><br />
            There is no universal &ldquo;best.&rdquo; Start with lower-shedding or hair-type coats (e.g., Poodle varieties, Bichon, some terriers,
            Portuguese Water Dog), then test your personal response and confirm that the grooming workload fits your life.
