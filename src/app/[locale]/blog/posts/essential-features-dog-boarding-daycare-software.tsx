          <h2>Introduction: Why This Matters More Than Ever</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing the right dog boarding and daycare software is a decision that directly affects efficiency, client satisfaction, and your bottom line. Many providers promise an all-in-one solution, but with that promise often comes a high monthly fee, hidden payment processing costs, and extra features you’ll never actually use.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my experience operating a facility with 1,100+ clients, I’ve learned that most operators need only a set of core, high-impact features. In fact, I built my own platform—Petunia—because existing options were overpriced and made money twice: monthly subscription fees plus inflated in-house payment processing.

          <h2>1. The Core Features Every Facility Actually Needs</h2>

          <h3>Client & Pet Management</h3>
          <p>
            Your software should store all essential client and pet details, including contact information, breed, spay/neuter status, allergies, and behavior notes. This ensures you can access accurate records quickly to make safe, informed decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Vaccine Tracking & Proof Storage</h3>
          <p>
            Automatic vaccine tracking and document uploads save you from manual reminders and compliance risk. The best systems can send clients expiration reminders and block bookings until records are updated.
          </p>

          <h3>On-Property Dog Visibility</h3>
          <p>
            At any given moment, you and your staff should be able to see which dogs are on-site, their scheduled departures, and any special care notes.
          </p>

          <h3>Alerts & Notifications</h3>
          <p>
            Automated alerts for new bookings, vaccine expirations, and same-day check-ins/out help ensure nothing is missed.
          </p>

          <h3>Mobile-First Access</h3>
          <p>
            Staff shouldn’t be chained to a desk. Mobile access allows check-ins, feeding/med tracking, and note updates directly from the yard.
          </p>

          <h3>Waiver & Legal Document Management</h3>
          <p>
            Facilities should be able to upload a custom waiver, require e-signature on first booking, and store signed documents securely in the client profile.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>2. Features You Might Think You Need—But Probably Don’t</h2>
          <h3>In-App Photo & Video Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            These features are expensive in terms of storage and slow down workflows. A dedicated business phone can send media faster and more cheaply.
          </p>

          <h3>Payroll & Tax Filing</h3>
          <p>
            These are better handled by dedicated payroll providers, which are often more affordable and more compliant.
          </p>

          <h3>Complex Staff Scheduling</h3>
          <p>
            For small teams, heavy scheduling modules aren’t worth the cost. Focus on care and safety features first.
          </p>

          <h2>3. The Problem with Payment Processing “Double Dipping”</h2>
          <p>
            Many software companies charge both a high subscription fee and inflated in-house payment processing rates—sometimes 3–4%. This increases your operating costs and your clients’ bills unnecessarily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choose software that lets you integrate with low-cost processors like Square or Stripe, and avoid being locked into expensive payment gateways.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Privacy & Security: Your Data Should Be Yours</h2>
          <p>
            Your provider should commit to no third-party data sharing and allow you to retain ownership of your client list and records. Look for encryption and role-based access control.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Regional Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            While the essentials are universal, some regions have additional requirements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>UK/Ireland:</strong> Licensed kennels must keep detailed care logs; easy report exports are useful.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Australia/NZ:</strong> Some states require temperature, feeding, and cleaning logs—mobile logging is key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Canada:</strong> Provincial kennel regulations vary; configurable vaccine fields are helpful.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Closing Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            The right software meets your actual needs, is affordable, and keeps your team with the dogs—not buried in admin screens. Focus on the essentials, keep costs predictable, and choose a vendor who respects your business.
