          <p className="mb-4">
            Marketing for dog boarding and dog daycare is won locally with proof, rhythm, and empathy. Your highest-ROI stack looks like this: a fast, trustworthy website; a fully optimized Google Business Profile; a drumbeat of review requests; organic Facebook &amp; Instagram with short, calm clips that show safety and joy; 1–2 paid offers aimed at &quot;new to facility&quot; and &quot;win back&quot; audiences; and a monthly email/SMS that rewards loyalty. Keep it simple, measurable, and kind. Owners book where they feel safe, informed, and respected.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Think &quot;Help, then sell.&quot; Teach owners how you keep dogs calm &amp; safe, then ask for the booking. Trust scales faster than hype.

          <p className="mb-3">
            This playbook is written for owners and managers of dog boarding and dog daycare facilities ranging from small, home-grown operations to multi-room, high-volume properties. It focuses on practical, low-bloat tactics you can implement this week without hiring an agency or buying expensive software you do not need. You will find step-by-step checklists, sample copy, content calendars, ad frameworks, and metrics that actually predict bookings.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> Copy &amp; paste the templates and ship your first month of content and emails.</li>
            <li><strong>Growing facilities:</strong> Layer on lightweight paid ads, referral rewards, and a reviews flywheel.</li>
            <li><strong>Busy operations:</strong> Assign owners vs managers vs front desk tasks with weekly cadences so nothing stalls.</li>

        <section id="positioning" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Brand Positioning: Say Less, Mean More</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Most facilities sound the same: &quot;We love dogs, we are safe, we care.&quot; Great, but owners cannot choose between identical promises. Positioning is the one-sentence reason you exist that a stranger can repeat. It should be true, specific, and provable through photos, reviews, and policies.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Positioning formula</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <em>For</em> [target owners] who want [outcome], <em>we</em> provide [unique approach] so that [evidence-backed benefit]. Unlike [common alternative], we [policy/proof you can show].
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Example (Daycare-first):</strong> &quot;For owners who value calm socialization over chaos, we run structured play blocks with planned sniff breaks and small, matched groups so dogs come home relaxed. Unlike drop-in free-for-alls, our program publishes daily room notes and recovery targets.&quot;</li>
            <li><strong>Example (Boarding-first):</strong> &quot;For dogs who thrive on routine, we design overnight stays around sleep, light, and quiet. Our rooms minimize arousal and our white-noise plan protects rest. We publish sleep notes and yard timing windows for each guest.&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm mt-3">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Positioning is a promise you must operationalize. If you say &quot;calm,&quot; your videos cannot be wall-to-wall sprint footage. Show slow tails, soft bodies, and post-yard naps.
          </div>

        {/* Website & SEO */}
        <section id="website-seo" className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Website &amp; SEO: Turn Curiosity Into a Booking</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Your website does two jobs: convert local searchers today and educate future clients so they trust you tomorrow. Pages must load quickly, explain your program without fluff, and make booking or requesting a meet-and-greet obvious. SEO is not magic; it is organized clarity that search engines can parse and that humans appreciate.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Must-have pages (and what to put on each)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Home:</strong> 3-sentence promise, 3 proof blocks (reviews, photos, policies), &quot;Book Boarding&quot; and &quot;Book Daycare&quot; buttons above the fold.</li>
            <li><strong>Boarding:</strong> sleep philosophy, rooms, feeding/meds policy, yard schedule, safety standards, exact steps to book, what to pack.</li>
            <li><strong>Daycare:</strong> assessment process, group structure, handler ratios, rest routine, pickup windows, temperament expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> transparent nightly/day rates, add-ons, multi-dog policy, cancellation policy in plain language.</li>
            <li><strong>About:</strong> owner philosophy, team photos (first names, roles), training/CPR certs, facility photos in daylight.</li>
            <li><strong>FAQ:</strong> vaccination list, intact/heat policy, fleas/ticks, medical issues, behavior standards, holiday hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact:</strong> click-to-call, email, map link, parking directions, drop-off flow.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Local SEO essentials</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across your site, Google Business Profile, Facebook, and directories.</li>
            <li>Embed a <code>LocalBusiness</code> schema snippet (JSON-LD) with your hours, phone, and services so search engines understand your business.</li>
            <li>Write service-area blurbs that read like helpful guidance, not keyword stuffing: &quot;We serve families in [neighborhoods]&quot; plus travel-time notes.</li>
            <li>Publish 3–6 &quot;pillar&quot; blog posts that owners actually need: vaccines &amp; deadlines, what to pack, how assessments work, med instructions, senior dog boarding tips.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Load speed matters. Compress images, keep your fonts simple, and avoid auto-playing heavy video on mobile. If it feels slow on your phone, it is costing you calls.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Add &quot;proof blocks&quot; on every key page: a review quote, a policy excerpt, and a daylight photo. Repetition of proof builds trust.
          </div>

        {/* Google Business Profile */}
        <section id="gbp" className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Google Business Profile: The Front Door of Local Search</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Most owners will discover you or judge you here. Treat your profile like a miniature website you update weekly. Name must match your signage, categories should include &quot;Dog Day Care Center&quot; and/or &quot;Kennel&quot; (local wording varies), hours must be correct, and photos should show calm dogs, clean rooms, and humans in the frame for scale and warmth.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Five things to fix this week</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Upload 12–20 fresh photos: sunlight, tidy spaces, soft-body dog greetings, staff at work, front desk with signage.</li>
            <li>Write a 750-character description using natural language about boarding/daycare, safety, sleep, and intake process.</li>
            <li>Set services with descriptive blurbs (Boarding, Daycare, Puppy Daycare, Senior Care, Medication Administration, Enrichment Walks).</li>
            <li>Enable messaging if you can staff it reliably; otherwise funnel to call/text/email with clear CTAs.</li>
            <li>Publish a weekly &quot;Update&quot; with a single tip: &quot;What to pack for boarding,&quot; &quot;How assessments work,&quot; &quot;Our nap routine.&quot;</li>
          </ol>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Rename photos before uploading (e.g., <code>calm-dog-boarding-rooms.jpg</code>). It helps context without spammy captions.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Reviews &amp; Reputation: Your Quiet Growth Engine</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Reviews are not vanity; they are conversion levers. A steady cadence of authentic, specific reviews beats occasional essays. Respond with grace, thank people by first name, and describe one concrete detail from the visit. For difficult reviews, acknowledge, explain policy calmly, and offer a path forward offline.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">A simple reviews flywheel</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Tag new clients at check-in. After pickup, send a text/email with a friendly, non-pushy link.</li>
            <li>Rotate staff names so clients mention them (&quot;Sasha took great care of Luna&quot;), which builds your employer brand.</li>
            <li>Print a tiny QR card for the front desk with &quot;Was your experience helpful?&quot; and a smile. Hand it to happy owners.</li>
            <li>Celebrate reviews in a monthly staff huddle. People repeat what is recognized.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Avoid incentives that violate platform rules. Instead, reward staff internally when reviews mention excellent care. Keep it clean and ethical.

        {/* Organic Social */}
        <section id="organic-social" className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Organic Social: Show Safety, Joy, and Routine</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            You do not need viral content. You need repeatable, calm proof that your program is safe, structured, and kind. Owners want to recognize your facility &amp; your team in the feed and feel reassured that their dog will do well there. Build a simple calendar and stick to it.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Still the backbone for local parents. Post albums and events; reply to DMs quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Carousels with captions that educate. Short Reels with soft music. Avoid chaotic clips.</li>
            <li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Use sparingly if your audience is not there. Focus on calm, informative snippets over trends.</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> 60–120 second explainers (&quot;Our assessment day&quot;). Great for embedding on your site.</li>

            You do not need a massive budget or complicated audiences. Pick two evergreen offers and show them to local parents near your facility. Use gentle creative that mirrors your organic posts so the ad feels like you, not a gimmick.

            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Leads or Messages for small teams; Conversions if your site is fast and ready.</li>
            <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Radius 5–12 miles; age 25–64; expand if you serve commuters. Exclude current followers for &quot;new to facility&quot; ads.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative:</strong> 15-second calm clip, 1–2 dog faces, handler visible. Headline: &quot;Calm, structured play. Happy, tired dogs.&quot;</li>
            <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Start small. Allocate most to your best creative; turn off losers early.</li>

            If your competitors run search ads and you rank poorly, a small search budget on &quot;dog boarding near me&quot; and &quot;dog daycare near me&quot; may bridge the gap. Keep keyword sets tight, match your landing page to the query, and watch mobile experience obsessively.

            The heart of your program travels well, but laws and etiquette vary. In Canada, consent rules for commercial messages are stricter; in the UK and Ireland, privacy and advertising standards emphasize clear transparency; in Australia and New Zealand, community pages and local groups can be unusually strong drivers. Always write like a neighbor, not a franchise.

            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Get explicit permission for marketing SMS and email. Make opting out painless.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Be precise about pricing, what is included, and any assessments required.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How many posts per week do we need?</strong><br />
            5–7 light touches across platforms is plenty if the content is calm, helpful, and consistent. Quality &gt; volume.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Should we try every platform?</strong><br />
            No. Master Facebook and Instagram first. Add YouTube shorts for explainers if you have capacity. TikTok only if your local parents are active there.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What budget should we start with on ads?</strong><br />
            Start small. Run one new-client offer and one practice-night ad. Keep what is working; turn off what is not. Increase only when your response is fast and your landing page converts.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How do we avoid &quot;chaos content&quot;?</strong><br />
            Film in quiet windows, keep clips to 10–20 seconds, show handler presence, and favor soft body language. Owners do not crave excitement; they crave assurance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xs text-gray-600">
            Educational content only. Always follow local advertising and privacy regulations and platform policies.
