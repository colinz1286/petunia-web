          <p className="mb-4">
            Kennel cough‚Äîbetter called canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC)‚Äîis a contagious, multi-pathogen respiratory syndrome.
            It moves dog-to-dog via droplets, aerosols, and contaminated hands/objects. Even in a clean, well-run facility with vaccine
            requirements, some cases will occur because vaccines reduce severity and shedding but cannot block every organism or exposure.
            The professional response is empathy first, facts second, a clear veterinary plan, reasonable goodwill, and transparent
            communication with other clients when indicated.

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Use Petunia to log vaccine dates (Bordetella/CPIV/CAV-2; optional influenza), meds, and a temporary
            ‚Äúrespiratory rest‚Äù flag. That keeps your team, owners, and veterinarians aligned on return-to-care timelines and reduces back-and-forth.

        <section id="what-is-cirdc" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What Kennel Cough/CIRDC Actually Is</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            CIRDC isn&#39;t one germ; it&#39;s a syndrome caused by several viruses and bacteria (for example Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parainfluenza
            virus, canine adenovirus-2, Mycoplasma spp., and others). That is why one dog may show a mild, dry cough and another may look sicker‚Äî
            multiple organisms and host factors are in play. Most healthy adult dogs recover in 7‚Äì10 days with rest and veterinary guidance. Severe
            disease, pneumonia, or prolonged recovery are more likely in puppies, seniors, and dogs with other conditions.
          </p>

        {/* Incubation & spread */}
        <section id="incubation" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Incubation &amp; How It Spreads</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Incubation window:</strong> typically about 2‚Äì10 days. A dog can appear healthy at drop-off and cough at home days later.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> close nose-to-nose contact, cough/sneeze droplets, shared water bowls/toys, and human hands/clothing moving between dogs.</li>
            <li><strong>Group settings:</strong> anywhere dogs mingle‚Äîboarding, daycare, classes, shows, parks‚Äîraises exposure opportunities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-3">
            This timing is essential for complaint handling: a cough after pickup does not prove infection occurred in your facility; exposure often
            happens <em>before</em> the visit (dog park, grooming, class) and only shows up days later.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Vaccines */}
        <section id="vaccines" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Vaccines Help‚Äîbut Don&#39;t Make Risk Zero</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Bordetella/CPIV and CAV-2 vaccines (often given as intranasal/oral combos for local airway immunity) and optional canine influenza vaccines
            substantially improve the situation: vaccinated dogs tend to get milder signs and shed less. But because CIRDC has many pathogens and
            exposure routes, vaccinated dogs can still cough. Your policy should set expectations clearly: vaccination is required to reduce risk,
            not to create an absolute guarantee.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">It&#39;s Not About a ‚ÄúDirty‚Äù Facility</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Good sanitation, ventilation, and staff hygiene matter‚Äîand you should be excellent at them. But CIRDC spreads primarily through dog-to-dog
            contact, droplets, aerosols, and shared objects. That means <em>even spotless facilities</em> will see cases when an infected dog enters,
            just as kids bring home colds from school. Your message to clients should be: we minimize risk with science-based protocols, and we respond
            quickly and transparently when illness appears.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Low-Exposure Dogs Can Get Sicker</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Dogs that rarely mix with others (and many puppies) may not have prior exposure or vaccine-primed mucosal immunity to common respiratory
            organisms. When these ‚Äúna√Øve‚Äù dogs first enter busy environments, they can be more susceptible and sometimes show stronger signs. This
            isn&#39;t a character flaw or a cleanliness issue‚Äîit&#39;s basic immunology plus environment. Clear expectations and a slow, well-planned
            reintroduction to group play after recovery make future visits smoother.

Hi {`{{clientFirstName}}`},

Thank you for speaking with us today. We&#39;re sorry {`{{dogName}}`} is coughing‚ÄîCIRDC (often called kennel cough) is common wherever dogs
socialize. Because incubation is typically 2‚Äì10 days, signs can appear after a visit even when a facility is clean and vaccines are required.
Vaccination reduces severity and shedding but doesn&#39;t eliminate risk.

Next steps:
‚Ä¢ Please contact your veterinarian for guidance today.
‚Ä¢ Rest, hydration, and any prescribed meds as directed.
‚Ä¢ Out of an abundance of caution, we&#39;ll pause {`{{dogName}}`}‚Äôs attendance until your vet clears a return.

We‚Äôve added a {`{{creditAmount}}`} credit to your account as a goodwill gesture. If you have questions, reply here anytime.

            <strong>Did the facility cause my dog&#39;s cough?</strong><br />
            No single worker ‚Äúcauses‚Äù CIRDC. An infected dog brings it in, and it spreads the way colds spread in schools or offices. Clean, well-run
            facilities reduce risk but can&#39;t make it zero anywhere dogs mix.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>My dog is vaccinated. Why did they still cough?</strong><br />
            Vaccines reduce severity and shedding and are still strongly recommended. But because CIRDC involves many organisms and exposure routes,
            vaccinated dogs can occasionally get mild illness.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How long does it last?</strong><br />
            Many dogs improve in about a week to ten days with rest and vet guidance. Puppies, seniors, or dogs with other issues may need more care‚Äî
            follow your veterinarian&#39;s instructions closely.
