            Your best diet is <strong>complete &amp; balanced for the right life stage</strong>, fits your dog’s size and activity,
            and is delivered with <strong>portion control, body condition monitoring, and consistent routines</strong>. Avoid
            marketing traps (ingredient buzzwords) and focus on four signals: (1) the AAFCO <em>nutritional adequacy</em> statement,
            (2) the manufacturer’s transparency &amp; quality control, (3) your dog’s condition/performance on the food, and
            (4) safety basics: storage, hygiene, and gradual changes.

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> In your Petunia profile, create a <em>“Food &amp; Feeding”</em> note with your dog’s ideal weight,
            current food (photo of the AAFCO statement + lot number), daily gram/cup portion, BCS photo (top/side), treat log
            (&lt;10% of calories), and a 7-day transition plan template. Share it with family/sitters so the plan survives real life.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How to Think About Dog Food (Systems, Not Slogans)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Nutrition is a <em>system</em>, not a slogan. Labels and ads are loud; your dog’s body is the quiet dashboard.
            Start with <strong>complete &amp; balanced</strong> food appropriate to age/size/activity, then run a repeatable loop:
            <em> portion by calories → observe stool/skin/energy → track weight and Body Condition Score (BCS) → adjust</em>.
            When needs change (growth, training load, medical conditions), adjust the inputs—don’t chase marketing terms.
          </p>

        {/* LABELS */}
        <section id="labels" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Reading Labels (AAFCO, WSAVA, and What Actually Matters)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            On U.S. shelves, look for the <strong>AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement</strong>. It tells you whether a product is
            “complete &amp; balanced” for a life stage (e.g., <em>growth</em>, <em>adult maintenance</em>, <em>all life stages</em>) and whether it was
            <em> formulated</em> to meet nutrient profiles or proven via <em>feeding trials</em>. Ingredients must be listed by common name
            in descending order by weight, and FDA expects truthful labeling and good manufacturing practices. “Premium/holistic”
            terms are <em>marketing</em>, not regulatory categories. Use WSAVA’s owner tools to evaluate brand transparency and nutrition support.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>“All life stages” = meets growth/repro standards; some foods specify <em>including growth of large size dogs</em> (70 lb+).</li>
            <li>Ingredient order is by <em>pre-processing weight</em>; fresh meats rank high partly due to water.</li>
            <li>Focus on the <em>whole diet’s</em> adequacy, not single ingredients.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm mt-3">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Snap a clear photo of the AAFCO statement on the bag/can and save it with the lot number.
            It’s gold for your vet if troubleshooting or reporting a quality issue.

        {/* LIFE STAGE & SIZE */}
        <section id="life-stage" className="mb-10">

          <p className="mb-3">
            Pick a diet labeled for your dog’s current life stage and relevant size/needs. Puppies require higher protein, energy, and
            precise mineral balance; seniors may benefit from adjusted calories, protein targets, and joint/renal considerations
            (with your vet). Large-breed puppies (≥70 lb adult) have <em>special growth constraints</em>—choose foods that explicitly say
            they’re appropriate for “growth, including the growth of large size dogs,” or “all life stages including large size dogs,”
            and heed calcium/phosphorus limits to reduce growth-related orthopedic risks.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li><strong>Puppies:</strong> Growth diet; for large-breed pups, verify the “including growth of large size dogs (70 lb+)” language.</li>
            <li><strong>Adults:</strong> Adult maintenance unless breeding/working demands a higher energy density.</li>
            <li><strong>All life stages:</strong> Adequate for growth/repro; portion carefully for sedentary adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Use explicit repro/growth formulas late gestation through lactation.</li>
          </ul>

        {/* CALORIES & BCS */}
        <section id="calories" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Calories, Body Condition, and Portion Math (Owner-Grade)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Start with RER (Resting Energy Requirement) ≈ <strong>70 × BW(kg)<sup>0.75</sup></strong>. Multiply by a life-stage/activity factor
            to estimate daily calories, then refine weekly using BCS and scale/measurements. Treats should be ≤<strong>10%</strong> of daily calories;
            adjust the main diet if you go over.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#fffaf2] p-4 text-sm mb-3">
            <strong>Example:</strong> 20-kg adult, moderately active. RER ≈ 70 × 20<sup>0.75</sup> ≈ 662 kcal. Daily target ≈ 1.4 × RER ≈ 925 kcal.
            If treats ~90 kcal/day, main food allotment ≈ 835 kcal/day. Convert using the label’s kcal/cup or kcal/can.
          </div>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>Use a kitchen scale for accuracy (grams beat cups).</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Dry (kibble) is convenient, stable, and energy-dense. Canned/wet offers higher moisture and palatability. Air-dried,
            baked, or freeze-dried/frozen “fresh” diets vary widely—<em>the label must still say complete &amp; balanced</em> for your
            dog’s life stage. Moisture influences how much your dog drinks; dogs on canned diets often drink less because their
            food carries more water. Storage/hygiene practices matter regardless of format.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> For picky eaters, try a “consistency first” rule: fix mealtimes, weigh portions, add a <em>measured</em>
            topper that doesn’t exceed 10% of calories, and stop free-feeding. Appetite often normalizes within a week.

          <p className="mb-3">
            “By-product” means a secondary product from processing—not “waste.” Nutritional quality depends on sourcing and processing,
            and by-products/meals can be highly digestible, nutrient-dense ingredients when defined and used properly. The label’s
            <em> adequacy</em> and the company’s quality control matter more than that single word.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">“Grain-free” and DCM context</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been investigated extensively. The FDA has not established a definitive
            causal relationship with any specific ingredient or brand. Work with your veterinarian if you have a breed at risk or
            if your dog is on a legume-rich/exotic-ingredient diet—diet history and appropriate screening can be individualized.
            Above all, choose a manufacturer that provides robust formulation/QA transparency.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Hydration &amp; Moisture: Quiet Performance Multiplier</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Typical daily water needs land around ~40–70 mL/kg/day in thermoneutral conditions, modulated by diet moisture, heat,
            and activity. Canned diets contribute substantial water; dry-fed dogs should always have fresh water available. For
            dogs with low water intake or urinary issues, discuss strategies like adding moisture to meals or incorporating some
            canned food (within a complete &amp; balanced plan) with your veterinarian.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>Refresh bowls daily; clean food/water dishes regularly.</li>
            <li>During heat or work days, plan for extra water breaks; watch for panting and dark urine as early cues.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Dogs are dietary omnivores with flexible metabolism. At a minimum, protein must cover essential amino acids and support
            lean mass; fat supplies essential fatty acids and energy density; carbohydrates are a practical energy/fiber source that
            can aid stool quality and gut health. There is no single “magic” macro ratio—appropriate ranges depend on life stage,
            body condition, and activity.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Growth diets target higher g protein/1,000 kcal; adults need adequate but not excessive protein for maintenance.</li>
            <li><strong>Fat:</strong> Drives energy density and palatability; manage carefully in pancreatitis-prone individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbs &amp; fiber:</strong> Soluble/insoluble fiber blends influence stool, satiety, and the microbiome; switch gradually to avoid GI upset.</li>
          </ul>

                {/* FOOD SENSITIVITIES & TESTING */}
        <section id="sensitivities" className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Food Sensitivities &amp; Testing (What Works, What Doesn’t)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Dogs can react to components of food in two broad ways: <strong>immune-mediated</strong> (often called food allergy or
            cutaneous adverse food reaction, CAFR) and <strong>non-immune</strong> intolerance (e.g., fat intolerance, additive sensitivity).
            The clinical pictures often overlap—itchy skin/ears, chronic or recurrent GI signs—so diagnosis must rely on
            <em> response to diet</em>, not marketing terms or quick tests.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Gold Standard: The Elimination Diet + Challenge</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Phase 1 (Elimination):</strong> Feed a <em>single</em> complete &amp; balanced diet that the dog has <em>never</em> eaten before (novel protein/carb) <em>or</em> a <em>veterinary hydrolyzed</em> protein diet for <strong>8 weeks</strong> without any other foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 (Provocation/Challenge):</strong> Reintroduce the prior diet or a single suspect ingredient. <em>Flare = diagnosis.</em> Remove the trigger, return to the elimination diet, then add back items later one-by-one to map safe ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Why 8 weeks?</strong> Dermatologic signs may take that long to fully remit; some dogs need longer. GI signs often improve sooner (2–4 weeks) but still require the full course for clarity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">What About Blood, Saliva, Hair, or “Mail-In” Sensitivity Tests?</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            They are <strong>not</strong> reliable for diagnosing food allergy in dogs. Studies show poor repeatability and results that are no
            better than chance—including “positives” from fake or inanimate samples. Use your budget on a proper diet trial and coaching instead.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Hydrolyzed vs Novel Protein Diets</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Hydrolyzed:</strong> Proteins are broken into smaller fragments to reduce immune recognition. These diets are designed for trials and long-term feeding, but <em>no</em> diet is 100% risk-free for every dog.</li>
            <li><strong>Novel protein:</strong> Use a truly <em>new-to-your-dog</em> meat/carb combination. Beware cross-contact and “flavor” ingredients that reintroduce common proteins.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical pick:</strong> If your dog has eaten many proteins already, start with a veterinary hydrolyzed diet. If your history is clean (e.g., only chicken so far), a carefully chosen novel diet can work well.</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm mb-4">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> In your <em>Food &amp; Feeding</em> note, add a one-page <em>Diet Trial Contract</em> for the whole household:
            permitted foods (brand/flavor), exact grams/day, <em>approved treats only</em> (see list below), pill-pockets that match the trial, and a

            <li><strong>Medications/supplements:</strong> Ask your vet to avoid flavored meds. Confirm any chewables, pastes, or “natural flavor” match the trial.</li>
            <li><strong>Track outcomes:</strong> Weekly itch score (0–10), ear debris/odor, stool log (consistency, blood/mucus), vomiting episodes, weight/BCS photos.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> At week 8 (or when your vet advises), reintroduce the <em>previous</em> diet or a single ingredient for 3–14 days while logging signs.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Picking Proteins &amp; Fibers Strategically</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            After you identify safe ingredients, build a diet that your dog <em>thrives</em> on—good stool, healthy skin/ears, stable energy,
            and an ideal body condition. Two big levers are <strong>protein choice</strong> and the <strong>type/amount of fiber</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Protein Playbook</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Digestibility &amp; history:</strong> Prefer proteins your dog digests well and that have a clean history for skin/ear flares.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotate carefully:</strong> Once stable for 6–8 weeks, consider a <em>planned</em> rotation among safe options to broaden menu and resilience—<em>one</em> change at a time with a 7–10 day transition.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrolyzed long-term:</strong> Many dogs can remain healthy on a veterinary hydrolyzed diet indefinitely; monitor BCS, labs as advised, and skin/ear status.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Fiber Toolkit (Outcomes, Not Percentages)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            “Crude fiber” on labels misses soluble/insoluble nuance. Think outcomes: stool form, regularity, satiety, and GI comfort.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm mb-3">
            <li><strong>Large-bowel diarrhea/colitis:</strong> Blends of fermentable and non-fermentable fiber (e.g., beet pulp + cellulose/psyllium) can normalize stool and reduce urgency.</li>
            <li><strong>Weight &amp; satiety:</strong> Fiber can help dogs feel full on fewer calories while supporting stool quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Prebiotics (FOS/MOS, etc.):</strong> May improve stool consistency and support a healthy microbiome in some contexts; results vary by blend and dose.</li>
            <li><strong>EPI caution:</strong> In enzyme-dependent dogs, high insoluble, non-fermentable fiber can <em>interfere</em> with fat absorption; your vet may prefer lower insoluble fiber during stabilization.</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>How to test fiber safely:</strong> Hold the base diet steady. Add <em>one</em> change (e.g., 1 tsp/10 kg psyllium husk mixed with water, once daily) for 5–7 days. Track stool and comfort. Stop if gas/bloating or softer stool appears.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Avoid hard exercise just before or after meals; use multiple smaller meals and keep mealtime calm in bloat-prone dogs.</li>
            <li>For intense sessions, many teams feed the main meal well before exertion (often the prior evening) and use tiny, low-bulk “top-ups” away from peak activity.</li>
            <li>After training, cool down before feeding and offer several small water breaks instead of one huge chug.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Most healthy dogs meet fluid needs with free-choice water and a complete diet. A typical daily maintenance range is roughly forty to seventy milliliters per kilogram of body weight, adjusted for diet moisture, environment, and activity.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Because dogs primarily cool by panting, many exercise bouts cause water loss with minimal electrolyte loss; routine supplementation is usually unnecessary on balanced diets.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Dogs are exceptional fat oxidizers. For endurance tasks, higher-fat diets often improve stamina by increasing energy density; sprint-dominant sports benefit from accessible carbohydrate. Keep protein sufficient for tissue repair.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">

          <p className="mb-3">
            Obesity blunts performance, joint comfort, and heat tolerance. A sensible weight-loss rate is about one percent of body weight per week with rechecks every two weeks and calorie adjustments as needed.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Set the target:</strong> calculate RER at ideal weight and feed an energy-restricted, high-nutrient density diet; many programs start near sixty percent of maintenance for the target weight, then titrate.</li>
            <li><strong>Protein and fiber:</strong> preserve lean mass and satiety with adequate protein and smart fiber blends; consider a veterinary weight-management formula.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> prefer frequent, moderate sessions and skill work over repetitive high-impact fetch.</li>

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Weigh every fourteen days. If weekly loss is under half a percent, reduce calories by five to ten percent; if loss exceeds one-and-a-half percent and the dog is hungry, increase by about five percent and reassess.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Start with the <strong>nutritional adequacy statement</strong> on the label. AAFCO recognizes life stages as
            <em> gestation/lactation</em>, <em>growth</em>, <em>maintenance</em>, and <em>all life stages</em> (which also meets growth).
            “Senior” is a marketing term rather than a separate AAFCO life stage; what matters is whether the formula is complete
            and balanced for your dog’s current needs.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Look for the exact wording: <strong>“including growth of large size dogs (70 lb or more as an adult)”</strong>.
            If a product says <em>“except for growth of large size dogs …”</em>, it is not appropriate for large-breed puppies.
            This wording reflects tighter mineral limits (notably calcium) during growth.

          <p className="mb-3">
            “Kibble,” “canned,” “air-dried,” “fresh-cooked,” “freeze-dried,” and “raw” describe <em>processes</em> rather than nutrition by
            themselves. Your job is to pair a <strong>complete &amp; balanced</strong> formula with a process you can store, handle, and feed
            consistently—with safety and stool quality that fit your dog and your household.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Dry/Kibble (Extruded or Baked)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>How it’s made:</strong> Ingredients are ground, mixed into dough, then cooked under heat/pressure and dried; vitamins may be added after cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Owner view:</strong> shelf-stable, consistent calories per cup, easy to weigh; watch storage (cool, dry, sealed) and bag lot numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Dog view:</strong> energy-dense; stool typically firm when digestibility is good; hydration must come from water or toppers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Canned/Wet (Retorted)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>How it’s made:</strong> Formulated mixture is filled and sealed in cans or pouches, then sterilized under heat/pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Owner view:</strong> higher moisture, great for appetite/urinary goals; heavier to store/ship; watch dented or bulging cans—discard.</li>
            <li><strong>Dog view:</strong> very palatable; often smaller dry-matter portions for the same calories due to water content.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Air-Dried / Dehydrated / Baked “Lightly Processed”</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Lower moisture than canned, often higher than kibble; texture varies by brand.</li>
            <li>Still requires a verified <em>complete &amp; balanced</em> adequacy statement for your life stage; “minimal processing” is marketing, not a guarantee of nutrient balance or safety.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Freeze-dried:</strong> water is removed under vacuum at low temps; some products are fed as-is or rehydrated. Pathogen risk depends on controls; rehydration improves safety and stool quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Raw (frozen or fresh):</strong> may be high in bacteria if not validated by pathogen-reduction steps (e.g., HPP). Requires strict kitchen hygiene and careful handling, especially around kids, older adults, and immunocompromised people or pets.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> whatever the process, ensure the label states <em>complete &amp; balanced</em> and that the manufacturer can explain validation and lot testing.</li>

            “Grain-free” is a formulation choice, not a health guarantee. Dogs can do well on diets <em>with</em> or <em>without</em> grains as long as the
            product is complete &amp; balanced and made by a transparent manufacturer with strong quality controls. Over the last several years,
            veterinary groups and regulators have reviewed cases of dilated cardiomyopathy potentially associated with certain formulas. A single
            cause has not been proven; ingredient lists alone rarely tell the whole story. Your guardrails:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Prioritize companies that can share who formulates their diets, how they test them, and what feeding trials or digestibility data exist.</li>
            <li>Match diet to your dog’s needs (life stage, breed size, activity) and monitor results (weight, stamina, stool, skin, and periodic exams).</li>
            <li>If you have a breed predisposed to heart disease or you’re on a legume-rich or exotic-ingredient diet, talk with your veterinarian about individualized screening.</li>
