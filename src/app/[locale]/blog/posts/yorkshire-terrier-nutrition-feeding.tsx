        {/* TLDR */}
        <section id="tldr" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terriers require nutrient-dense meals, small portions, and consistent feeding schedules due to their fast metabolism and tiny stomachs. High-quality toy-breed formulas, careful dental care, and close monitoring for weight gain or hypoglycaemia are essential. Their unique nutritional needs continue throughout life, making proper feeding strategies critical for long-term health.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* METABOLISM */}
        <section id="metabolism" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Understanding Toy-Breed Metabolism</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terriers have rapid metabolic rates and burn calories more quickly per pound than larger breeds. Because of this, they need calorie-dense food and small, frequent meals to maintain stable energy. Studies on small-breed growth patterns show that energy requirements shift significantly over the first year, highlighting the importance of breed-appropriate nutrition. Toy breeds also lose heat faster and cannot store energy as efficiently, which further increases their daily caloric needs.

        {/* FEEDING SCHEDULE */}
        <section id="schedule" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Feeding Schedule and Portion Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            Because of their small stomach capacity, Yorkshire Terrier puppies usually need three to four meals each day. By adulthood, most transition comfortably to two or three smaller meals. Consistent scheduling helps maintain blood sugar, especially during growth. Owners should monitor body condition regularly and adjust portions based on activity level, age, and individual metabolism.

        </section>

        {/* CHOOSING FOOD */}
        <section id="choosing-food" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Choosing the Right Food for Yorkies</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terriers benefit from toy-breed formulas designed with small kibble size, high protein content, and appropriate fat levels to support their energy needs. Puppy formulas should be rich in digestible proteins and essential fatty acids to support growth and coat development. Adult Yorkies thrive on balanced diets containing quality animal proteins, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and controlled carbohydrate sources. Foods formulated specifically for small dogs help maintain muscle mass and overall vitality.

        {/* SPECIAL RISKS */}
        <section id="special-risks" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Special Nutritional Risks in Yorkshire Terriers</h2>
          <p>
            Hypoglycaemia is a well-known risk in toy-breed puppies, especially under 12 weeks old. Consistent feeding routines help reduce drops in blood sugar. Yorkshire Terriers are also prone to early dental disease, making kibble texture and dental hygiene important parts of their feeding plan. Weight gain can happen quickly in small breeds, so measured portions and regular veterinary checkups are essential for long-term health.

        {/* BOARDING */}
        <section id="boarding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Feeding Needs in Boarding and Daycare Settings</h2>
          <p>
            When staying at a boarding or daycare facility, Yorkshire Terriers should continue their established feeding schedule without changes. Bringing food from home prevents digestive upset and ensures caloric consistency. Staff should be aware of toy-breed eating habits, including the need for smaller portions and careful monitoring for fatigue or signs of low blood sugar. Structured routines help Yorkies feel secure when away from home.
          </p>

        {/* CONCLUSION */}
        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            With careful meal planning, high-quality nutrition, and consistent routines, Yorkshire Terriers can maintain excellent health throughout their lives. Paying attention to portion sizes, metabolism, dental care, and toy-breed risks ensures your Yorkie gets the nourishment they need. Thoughtful feeding is one of the most important investments an owner can make in their dog’s long-term well-being.
