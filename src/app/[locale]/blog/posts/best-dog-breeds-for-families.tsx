          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            The best dogs for families with young kids are patient, gentle, trainable, and adaptable. 
            Breeds like Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Beagles, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels 
            consistently rank among the most family-friendly. Families should still consider size, 
            energy levels, and time commitments. With the right training, safety practices, and daycare 
            options, dogs and children can thrive together.

        <section id="what-makes" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What Makes a Breed Family-Friendly?</h2>
          <p>
            Family-friendly breeds typically share these traits:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Gentle temperament:</strong> Not easily provoked by noise or rough play</li>
            <li><strong>Trainability:</strong> Willing to learn house rules and commands quickly</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Comfortable in busy households with changing schedules</li>
            <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Tolerant of children’s unpredictable behavior</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate energy:</strong> Enough stamina for play, but not overwhelming</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While breed tendencies matter, individual personality, early socialization, and 
            training are equally important.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Top Dog Breeds for Families with Young Kids</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Labrador Retriever</h3>
          <p>
            Labs are consistently America’s favorite family dog. Friendly, loyal, and playful, 
            they bond strongly with children. Their size and energy mean they need training and 
            daily exercise, but their even temper makes them reliable companions.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Golden Retriever</h3>
          <p>
            Known for their patience and affectionate nature, Golden Retrievers are great with 
            kids of all ages. They are gentle yet active, thriving in households that provide 
            exercise, training, and plenty of attention.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Beagle</h3>
          <p>
            Beagles are smaller, cheerful, and curious dogs. Their compact size makes them 
            less intimidating for young kids, and their friendly nature fits well in family 
            environments. They do require regular exercise and mental stimulation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h3>
          <p>
            These affectionate lap dogs are gentle and eager to please. Cavaliers are well-suited 
            to both apartments and larger homes. They are tolerant of children but still require 
            careful supervision to avoid being overwhelmed by rough play.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Boxer</h3>
          <p>
            Boxers are playful, protective, and high-energy. They love being around kids and can 
            be natural guardians. Early training and consistent exercise are essential to manage 
            their enthusiasm.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Poodle (Standard or Miniature)</h3>
          <p>
            Poodles are intelligent, trainable, and hypoallergenic. Their variety of sizes 
            allows families to choose what fits best. They thrive with mental enrichment 
            and structured play.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Mixed Breeds</h3>
          <p>
            Many mixed-breed dogs make excellent family pets. Adopting from a shelter can 
            provide loving, adaptable companions while giving a dog in need a forever home. 
            Temperament should be assessed individually.

        <section id="challenges" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Challenges Families Should Consider</h2>
          <p>
            Even with the best breeds, families face challenges:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Time commitment:</strong> Dogs require training, exercise, and grooming</li>
            <li><strong>Size considerations:</strong> Large dogs may unintentionally knock over toddlers</li>
            <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Some breeds shed heavily and trigger sensitivities</li>
            <li><strong>Energy mismatches:</strong> High-energy dogs may frustrate families with calmer lifestyles</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Planning for these challenges ensures a smoother integration between dog and child.

        <section id="safety" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Safety Tips for Kids and Dogs</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Always supervise young children around dogs</li>
            <li>Teach kids to respect boundaries: no ear-pulling or climbing</li>
            <li>Provide dogs with a quiet retreat space</li>
            <li>Use positive reinforcement to reward gentle interactions</li>
            <li>Enroll in basic obedience training for consistent communication</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Children should be taught that dogs are companions, not toys. Respect builds trust.

        <section id="daycare" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Daycare and Boarding Insights for Family Dogs</h2>
          <p>
            Family dogs often benefit from structured daycare. Socialization with other dogs, 
            exercise, and supervision prevent boredom and destructive behavior. For households 
            with young kids, daycare provides a healthy outlet when families are busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When boarding family dogs, choose facilities with experienced staff, safe playgroups, 
            and clear vaccination requirements. Familiar toys or bedding can reduce stress during stays.
          </p>

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>

            The best dog breeds for families with young kids are those that balance patience, 
            playfulness, and trainability. From Labradors to Cavaliers, many breeds thrive in
