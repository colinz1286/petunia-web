          Pet Owners Underestimate Lifetime Costs: New Study Reveals Hidden Financial Risk
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
          A 2025 study has revealed a widespread blind spot among pet owners: most dramatically underestimate the
          lifetime cost of caring for their animals. The research, published in the <em>Pet Lifetime of Care Study</em>,
          shows that veterinary bills, chronic health issues, emergencies, and daily living costs add up far more
          quickly than expected. For boarding and daycare providers, this data underscores why education and transparent
          communication with clients are essential. For owners, it highlights the need for long-term financial planning
          to ensure pets get the care they deserve without sudden financial strain.

          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">What the 2025 Study Found</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The <em>Pet Lifetime of Care Study</em> surveyed thousands of owners across multiple countries. Researchers
            found that while most people budget for adoption fees and early vaccinations, they rarely plan for chronic
            illnesses, specialized diets, advanced diagnostics, or repeated emergency visits. The average owner’s
            estimate of lifetime cost was only 40–60% of the actual figure. That gap widens as pets live longer thanks
            to improved veterinary care.

          <p className="mb-4">
            One of the starkest findings: <strong>emergencies are both common and costly</strong>. Roughly 1 in 3 dogs
            requires an emergency vet visit in their lifetime. Typical bills range from $1,000–$5,000, with surgeries
            or overnight hospitalization easily climbing higher. These sudden costs are where most families feel
            financial pain, and where lack of preparation leads to heart-wrenching decisions.

          <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
            <li><strong>U.S.:</strong> Veterinary inflation + regional wage pressures keep bills high.</li>

            businesses as trusted partners in long-term pet wellness. Articles like this can be shared with clients
            during onboarding to build trust.
