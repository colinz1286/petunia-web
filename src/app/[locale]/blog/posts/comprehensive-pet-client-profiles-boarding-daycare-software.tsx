          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Profiles Matter for Boarding &amp; Daycare</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            A facility is a living system. Dogs arrive with different health histories, social preferences, feeding routines, and family expectations. Without a
            strong profile layer, staff fall back to sticky notes, memory, and ad-hoc texting. That is when preventable errors happen: missed meds, wrong food,
            unsafe groupings, or a booking that should have been routed to an assessment first. A comprehensive profile is not a form for the sake of admin; it is
            the <strong>operating manual</strong> for each dog and household that drives safer decisions in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For software buyers, profiles are the difference between a calendar that looks good and a system that <em>runs the place</em>. The right profile schema enables
            eligibility checks, auto-messages, shift planning, group ratio logic, audit trails, and calm handoffs across staff. You stop firefighting and start hosting.

          <p className="mb-3">
            A comprehensive profile covers both <strong>the pet</strong> and <strong>the household</strong> with enough structure to power automation, yet enough flexibility to
            describe real-world nuance. A name, breed, and photo are not enough. A long free-text essay is not the answer either. The sweet spot is a hybrid:
            <em> structured fields for high-stakes items</em> and <em>compact notes</em> for the rest.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Structured:</strong> vaccine expirations, waiver timestamps, spayed&#x2F;neutered, weight class, medications, food instructions, behavior flags, emergency contacts.</li>

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> If you cannot <em>filter</em> or <em>sort</em> by a field, it probably should not be a free-text blob. Promote it to a yes&#x2F;no, dropdown, or number.

            A clean schema keeps profiles fast, queryable, and safe to evolve. You need a canonical record for each pet and household, plus read-optimized

            Many systems collect the right data in the wrong way: heavy forms, poor mobile behavior, and unclear error messages. Owners abandon or rush,

            Good pet onboarding focuses on safety, daily care, and staff clarity. Resist the temptation to ask 200 questions on day one. Start with critical

          <p className="mb-3">
            Vaccine and waiver fields do not belong to marketing or billing; they belong to safety. Profiles should link each vaccine entry to an <strong>expiry date</strong>,
            an <strong>image or PDF</strong>, and a <strong>review status</strong> (pending, approved, rejected with reason). Waivers should store the exact text agreed to and a
            timestamp. When policies change, the system prompts a one-tap re-agreement before a new booking proceeds.

          <p className="mb-3">
            The most common, high-impact errors on busy days involve meds and meals. Profiles should make these <strong>unmissable</strong>. Use both a quick-glance card

          <p className="mb-3">
            Profiles should prevent mistakes by design. If a dog is intact and your policy restricts group placement, the system should enforce it at booking
            and at check-in. If a vaccine is expiring, reminders go out before the stay. If meds are due, task cards appear at the right time for the right staff role.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Will comprehensive profiles slow down new client onboarding?</strong><br />
            Not if designed well. Use progressive steps, autosave, camera capture, and prefill for additional pets. Ask for the essentials today and enrich later.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>We already collect a lot of info in free-text notes. Why change?</strong><br />
            Free-text is hard to search, sort, and enforce. Structured fields power eligibility checks, ratios, reminders, and KPIs. Keep a compact notes section for nuance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do owners mind uploading documents?</strong><br />
            If it is easy and clearly tied to booking success, most owners cooperate quickly. Automated reminders and in-form camera capture raise compliance rates.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How do we keep staff from skipping updates on a busy day?</strong><br />
            Make updates one tap away on the live board. Reward completion during shift change and show how updates prevent real headaches tomorrow.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Can profiles improve revenue, not just safety?</strong><br />
            Yes. Better profiles reduce friction that causes cancellations, enable paid late checkout with confidence, and let you sell the right add-ons to the right dogs.
