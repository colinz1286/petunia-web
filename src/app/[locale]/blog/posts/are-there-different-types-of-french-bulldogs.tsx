          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Short Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            There is <strong>one French Bulldog breed</strong>. Within it, you’ll see different <em>looks</em>: coat colors and patterns
            (brindle, fawn, pied) that are <strong>recognized by kennel-club breed standards</strong>, plus non-standard (“exotic”) looks such as
            <strong> dilute “blue”</strong>, <strong>merle</strong>, and <strong>long-haired “fluffy”</strong> Frenchies. Non-standard colors/patterns and long coats are
            <em>disqualifications</em> in major show rings (AKC/FCI/KC), but they’re still Frenchies—just outside the show standard.
            Healthwise, <strong>all Frenchies share the same core needs</strong> (airway/heat management, spine/knee protection, skin/ear/eye care).
            A few color genes bring <em>extra considerations</em> (e.g., dilution alopecia risk in some “blue” coats; pigment-linked deafness risk in
            some piebald/merle lineages). Your best bet: choose <strong>ethical breeding</strong>, keep your dog <strong>lean and cool</strong>, and run a
            <em>boringly consistent</em> daily system.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Whatever your Frenchie’s color or coat, store your airway plan, heat rules, feed grams, fold/ear routine,
            and emergency contacts in Petunia. Shared checklists turn “type” debates into real-world comfort and safety.
          </div>

        {/* ONE BREED */}
        <section id="one-breed" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">One Breed, Many Looks</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            French Bulldogs come in a surprising variety of appearances—mostly because of <strong>coat color genetics</strong> and a few
            strongly selected head/body traits. But there aren’t “sub-breeds.” Reputable registries recognize a <em>single</em> breed
            with a formal standard that describes <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>temperament</strong>, and <strong>permitted colors/patterns</strong>. In show contexts,
            dogs outside the written standard can’t compete in conformation, yet they’re still French Bulldogs in everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re deciding between a brindle pet and a fluffy pet, think less about labels and more about <strong>breeder ethics</strong>,
            <strong> health screening</strong>, and your plan for heat, airway, and enrichment. That’s what changes outcomes.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* RECOGNIZED COLORS */}
        <section id="recognized" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Officially Recognized Colors &amp; Patterns</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Major kennel clubs describe the French Bulldog coat as <strong>short and smooth</strong> and limit colors/patterns to a small set.
            While wording differs, the theme is consistent: <strong>brindle</strong>, <strong>fawn</strong> (with or without a black mask), and <strong>pied</strong> are
            the classic looks. Many clubs explicitly list <em>disqualifying</em> colors/patterns (e.g., “mouse/blue,” liver, black and tan,
            and merle), and they also specify that long coats fall outside the standard. These rules apply to dog shows; they don’t
            stop people from owning or loving non-standard Frenchies.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Brindle:</strong> fawn background with varying black striping; from light tiger-brindle to nearly black.</li>
            <li><strong>Fawn:</strong> clear fawn shades with or without a black mask; cream tones vary by line.</li>
            <li><strong>Pied:</strong> white base with patches of brindle or fawn (patterns vary from minimal to heavy patching).</li>
            <li><strong>Always short, smooth coat</strong> under the show standard.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Why the strict list?</strong> Breed standards aim to maintain a recognizable silhouette and reduce health risks tied to
            certain pigment genes. Standards aren’t a guarantee of health—but they set <em>boundaries</em> for the show ring.
          </div>
        </section>

        {/* NONSTANDARD */}
        <section id="nonstandard" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Non-Standard/“Exotic” Colors &amp; Genetics (What to Know)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            You’ll see Frenchies advertised as <strong>blue</strong> (dilute gray), <strong>lilac/isabella</strong>, <strong>chocolate/cocoa</strong>, <strong>merle</strong>, or with
            unusual eye colors. These coats are real genetics—but they’re <em>not</em> allowed in most conformation shows. There’s a lot of
            internet argument here; let’s stay practical and evidence-based.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Dilute coats (often called “blue”)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>The dilute gene (<em>D</em> locus variants) turns black pigment toward slate gray (“blue”).</li>
            <li>Some dilute-colored dogs of various breeds develop <strong>color dilution alopecia (CDA)</strong>—patchy hair loss and skin issues.
              Not every dilute dog is affected, but it’s a known risk to monitor with your veterinarian.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Merle pattern</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Merle is a mottled coat pattern caused by variants at the <strong>M locus</strong>. Breeding two merle-patterned dogs can produce
              “double merle” puppies with a higher risk of <strong>hearing and ocular defects</strong>. Responsible programs avoid merle-to-merle
              pairings; many kennel clubs don’t accept merle Frenchies for registration or showing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">White/pied &amp; pigment-related deafness</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Across breeds, congenital deafness is associated with certain pigment pathways—classically <strong>piebald</strong> (heavy white)
              and <strong>merle</strong>. Many pied Frenchies hear perfectly; some don’t. Good breeders BAER-test lines when indicated and disclose results.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Bottom line: non-standard looks are cosmetic, but some <em>genes</em> carry extra health management. If you love a dilute, pied, or
            merle-patterned Frenchie, partner with an ethical breeder and proactive vet—and run the same daily systems that protect
            <em>every</em> Frenchie.

        <section id="fluffy" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Long-Haired “Fluffy” Frenchies</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            “Fluffy” refers to Frenchies with a visibly longer coat caused by <strong>recessive variants in the FGF5 gene</strong> (coat-length
            genetics shared across many breeds). Long coats are outside the major show standards for French Bulldogs, which require
            coats to be short and smooth. In day-to-day life, a fluffy is still a Frenchie—expect slightly more grooming and drying
            needs after baths or play, and the same airway/heat plan as any other brachycephalic dog.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> more frequent brushing; check for matting behind ears and armpits; dry thoroughly after water play.</li>
            <li><strong>Health:</strong> the coat gene itself doesn’t change airway anatomy. Prioritize weight control, cool rooms, and short play sets.</li>

        <section id="size" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Size Labels: “Mini,” “Micro,” and “Teacup” Claims</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            French Bulldogs have <strong>one size range</strong> under reputable standards (with a show-ring weight cap). Phrases like “mini,”
            “micro,” or “teacup” are marketing terms, not official types. Extra-small puppies may reflect selection for tiny size, runting,
            or crossbreeding; smaller isn’t automatically better. Focus on <strong>sound structure</strong>, <strong>health history</strong>, and <strong>temperament</strong>—not a
            label that suggests a different breed variety.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Buying tip:</strong> Ask any seller using size labels to show veterinary records, growth curves, and parents’ weights, and to
            explain how they avoid structural and metabolic problems in very small pups. Walk away from vague answers.

        {/* STRUCTURE */}
        <section id="structure" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Structure &amp; Line Differences (Companion vs. Show vs. “Sport”)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Within the breed, you’ll hear “European show type,” “American pet type,” or even “sport type.” These aren’t official
            categories; they’re shorthand for <strong>line selection</strong>. Some lines emphasize broader heads and heavier bone; others emphasize
            lighter frames and easier movement. From a welfare perspective, seek <strong>balance</strong>: open nostrils, comfortable breathing,
            moderate neck and chest, and a level, sturdy back with healthy rear angles. That combination supports cooling, walking, and
            play without constant strain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ask to see parents moving at a trot, then calmly at rest. You’re looking for <em>quiet, easy breathing</em> and <em>loose, comfortable
            gait</em>—the best predictor of a good life for any “type.”

        <section id="faq" className="mb-16">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Are there officially different “types” of French Bulldogs?</strong><br />
            No. There’s one breed. Kennel-club standards define recognized colors/patterns and coat type for the show ring. Non-standard
            looks (e.g., blue, merle, fluffy) exist but aren’t show-eligible; they’re still Frenchies at home.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do color genes affect temperament?</strong><br />
            Color doesn’t drive personality. Socialization, training, and daily structure do. Some pigment genes correlate with specific
            skin/ear/eye or hearing considerations—work with your vet to monitor.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is merle always unhealthy?</strong><br />
            Merle patterning can be managed responsibly in breeds where it’s established, but merle-to-merle pairings are risky for hearing
            and eyes. Many kennel clubs do not accept merle Frenchies for showing/registration. If you already own a merle pet, focus on
            great daily care and regular veterinary oversight.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Are “teacup” Frenchies a real type?</strong><br />
            “Teacup” is marketing, not an official variety. Prioritize health and structure over extreme smallness.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What should I prioritize when picking a puppy?</strong><br />
            Ethical humans, calm breathing, lean parents, thoughtful socialization, and a clear plan for heat/airway/skin care. Color is
            secondary.
