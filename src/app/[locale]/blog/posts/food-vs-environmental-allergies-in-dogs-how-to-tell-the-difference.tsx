        <p className="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
          Itchy paws. Red ears. Belly rashes that come and go. For many families, these signs blur together and it
          becomes unclear whether a dog is reacting to ingredients in meals or to particles in the world around them
          &#40;pollens, dust mites, molds&#41;. This guide translates dermatology best practices into clear, practical
          steps. You will learn how veterinarians separate the causes, how to run a correct elimination diet without
          loopholes, what everyday routines actually help, and where therapies like immunotherapy fit. The goal is not
          perfection overnight; it is fewer flares, better comfort, and a plan you can sustain.

            Dermatology workups usually begin by sorting signs into three practical categories. This is not because
            symptoms never overlap &#40;they often do&#41;, but because each category points to different first steps.

            <strong>Flea allergy dermatitis.</strong> A hypersensitivity to flea saliva. One bite can trigger a flare
            in a sensitive dog. Owners may not see a live parasite at all. The foundation is prevention for all pets
            and environmental cleaning.

            <strong>Food allergy / adverse food reaction.</strong> Often nonseasonal, commonly involves ears and paws,
            and may include digestive upset in some dogs. The only dependable way to diagnose is a strict elimination
            diet with a re-challenge afterward.
          </p>

            <strong>Environmental allergy &#40;canine atopic dermatitis&#41;.</strong> Hypersensitivity to airborne or

          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">Why Flea Control Comes First</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Every modern algorithm starts by confirming effective parasite control. Sensitive dogs can flare from a
            single bite, and owners often never see a live parasite because of grooming habits or recent bathing.
            The safest assumption is that prevention is always required, for every pet in the household, twelve months
            per year unless your veterinarian advises otherwise. Wash bedding on hot, vacuum frequently &#40;especially
            baseboards and upholstery&#41;, and treat outdoor areas when advised.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Elimination diet */}
        <section id="diet-trial" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">Food Allergy: Elimination Diet That Actually Works</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Blood panels, saliva kits, hair tests, and many commercial sensitivity screens are appealing shortcuts,
            but they cannot diagnose food allergy reliably. The dependable pathway is a strictly controlled
            elimination diet for 8â€“12 weeks, followed by a deliberate food challenge. If signs improve during the
            trial and return after re-exposure, food allergy is confirmed.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Choosing the trial diet</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Two common strategies work well. One uses a veterinary therapeutic hydrolyzed-protein formula in which
            proteins are broken into smaller fragments. The other uses truly novel ingredients your dog has never eaten
            before &#40;for example, a single uncommon protein paired with a simple carbohydrate&#41;. Grain-free vs.
            grain-inclusive is not the point; the point is avoiding previous proteins completely.
          </p>

          <div className="rounded-lg border p-4">
            <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Non-negotiable rules for the 8â€“12 week trial</h3>
            <ol className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Feed only the trial diet and water.</strong> No table scraps. No flavored chewables unless your
                veterinarian approves a compatible option. Keep a visible list on the fridge so everyone in the home
                follows the plan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Control treats and chews.</strong> If any are allowed, they must match the trial protein and
                have simple ingredients. Many families skip treats entirely for clarity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Give it time.</strong> Skin needs weeks to settle. Expect a full two months before you judge.
                Some dogs require up to twelve weeks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Re-challenge on purpose.</strong> After improvement, reintroduce the previous diet briefly.
                Return of signs confirms the diagnosis, which helps you commit to long-term changes with confidence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Build the long-term plan.</strong> Some families remain on the successful trial formula. Others
                re-introduce single proteins one at a time to map triggers and widen choices.

          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">Environmental Allergy: Testing and Long-Term Tools</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When patterns point to environmental triggersâ€”or a careful diet trial failsâ€”veterinarians may recommend
            allergen-specific testing to design immunotherapy. These tests are not for deciding whether a dog is truly
            allergic; that part is clinical. Testing identifies which pollens, mites, or molds to include in therapy.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Immunotherapy basics</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Custom extracts are prepared as injections or sublingual drops. Over months to years they can lower
            sensitivity and reduce flares. Many dogs still need adjunct care during peak seasons, but the overall
            requirement for anti-itch drugs often decreases. Immunotherapy is the only approach that can modify the
            allergic threshold itself rather than simply suppressing symptoms.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Medications that keep dogs comfortable</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Short courses of corticosteroids may be used for severe flares. Longer-term plans often rely on
            oclacitinib, lokivetmab, ciclosporin, and topical therapy &#40;shampoos, mousses, sprays, wipes&#41;.
            The mix depends on severity, season, and any co-morbidities such as recurrent ear disease.

              Treat every pet in the home, not just the itchy one. Consistency reduces surprise flares and prevents
              misdiagnosis during a diet trial.
            </p>

            <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Skin-care routine</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Gentle dog shampoos, thorough rinsing, and complete drying help remove allergens and control microbes.
              During bacterial or yeast overgrowth, your veterinarian may prescribe medicated products. Between baths,
              leave-on conditioners and antimicrobial wipes support the skin barrier.
            </p>

            <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Environmental hygiene</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Wash bedding weekly on hot. Vacuum frequently with a HEPA filter. Wipe paws and coat with a damp
              microfiber cloth after high-pollen outings. These steps lower the overall allergen burden so that
              medications work better at lower doses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Nutrition and supplements</h3>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Feed a complete, balanced diet appropriate for life stage. For dogs without food allergy, evidence-based
              omega-3 supplementation &#40;EPA/DHA&#41; can support the skin barrier and improve coat quality as part
              of a multi-modal plan. Discuss dosage and product quality with your veterinarian.

            and cytology to identify mites, bacteria, and yeast. Treat secondary infections promptly; they amplify itch

              Many dogs need eight full weeks. Some require twelve. Judging early leads to wrong conclusions, especially
              if infections are present or if treats sneak into the routine.

              Often, yesâ€”at least at first. Skin needs time to heal, and mixed disease is common. Your veterinarian
              will taper to the lowest effective plan over time.

              Immunotherapy is formulated based on allergen testing to reduce sensitivity to specific triggers. It is
              the only approach that can modify the allergic threshold rather than just suppressing signs. Many dogs
              still benefit from adjunct care during peak seasons.
