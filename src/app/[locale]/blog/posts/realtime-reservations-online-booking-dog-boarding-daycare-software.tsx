          <p className="mb-4">
            If you operate a modern facility, you already feel the pinch: clients expect to book from their phone, confirm instantly, and manage stays without
            calling during business hours. In practical terms, <strong>dog boarding software</strong> and <strong>dog daycare software</strong> must deliver two things very well:
            <em> live availability</em> that cannot be double-booked, and <em>online booking</em> that is fast, safe, and aligned with your policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facilities that adopt both see the same pattern: fewer manual messages, cleaner calendars, more predictable occupancy, and less friction on
            vaccine and waiver compliance. The system becomes your teammate: it politely enforces your rules while still feeling convenient for owners.
          </p>

        {/* What real-time means */}
        <section id="what-realtime" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What Real-Time Actually Means (and What It Does Not)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Real-time is not a marketing adjective. It is a <strong>guarantee that availability reflects the current truth</strong> at the moment a client clicks &quot;Book.&quot; It
            requires atomic updates so two humans cannot claim the last large kennel at the same time. It means holds, deposits, cancellations, and waitlist
            promotions <em>propagate instantly</em> across web, mobile, and staff screens.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Instant writes:</strong> a reservation deducts capacity immediately; every other user sees the change without refreshing.</li>
            <li><strong>Idempotency:</strong> repeated clicks or duplicate requests resolve to one booking, never two.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict handling:</strong> if two parties race for the last spot, one succeeds; the other gets a clear message and a waitlist offer.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent rules:</strong> grace windows, late checkout logic, and kennel-turn buffers are applied the same way for everyone, every time.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Treat <em>availability</em> as a first-class database object. Do not attempt &quot;calculate on the fly&quot; capacity exclusively. Maintain a
            lightweight, authoritative counter per day and per resource type (e.g., small kennel, large kennel, daycare spots), then reconcile nightly.
          </div>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Owners do not want to fill out a contact form and wait. They want to <strong>book a real reservation</strong> the same way they book a flight: pick dates,
            choose options, see price, pay deposit, and receive a confirmation instantly. The experience must be <strong>mobile-first</strong>, fast, and forgiving.

        <section id="ops-math" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Operations Math: How Live Booking Improves Occupancy</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Boarding revenue follows a simple skeleton: <code>kennel_nights_sold = kennels * nights_open * occupancy_rate</code>. Because price and kennels are
            relatively fixed in the short run, the fastest lever is <strong>occupancy</strong>. A real-time calendar with deposits and waitlists directly raises that rate by
            eliminating avoidable gaps and converting uncertain demand.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Common leak points (and fixes)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Phantom availability:</strong> spreadsheet lag leads to double-booking, so staff over-block &quot;just in case&quot;. Real-time removes the need for safety padding.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaps at turn:</strong> unclear checkout rules create unusable half-days. Make late checkout a paid addon that preserves turnover buffers.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending requests:</strong> &quot;We will get back to you&quot; kills momentum. Instant confirmations lock revenue while rules are enforced automatically.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Daycare math looks like <code>utilization = (attending_dogs ÷ daily_capacity)</code>. Online booking plus attendance controls (cutoff times,
            automatic reminders, and caps per weight group) pushes utilization up without bloating groups.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Real-time booking is only useful if it respects your safety policies. That is why <strong>gating</strong> must happen before checkout: the system checks
            vaccine expirations, waiver status, assessment flags, intact vs. spayed&#x2F;neutered rules, and any breed or behavior notes that affect eligibility.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Vaccine checks:</strong> require current documents on file; show a friendly &quot;action needed&quot; step with upload links if anything is missing.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiver logic:</strong> if your waiver has been updated, prompt a one-tap re-agree that stores a new timestamp.</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment routing:</strong> new dogs are auto-routed to limited assessment slots; &quot;isAssessment: true&quot; tags follow the reservation everywhere.</li>

          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Save an immutable record of the waiver text each client agreed to, plus the timestamp. If you change the waiver, require re-agreement
            once, not repeatedly. Your staff should never chase paperwork by hand.

              This mirrors the per-pet shape you already use, including fields such as <code>isAssessment</code>, medications, and spayed&#x2F;neutered flags.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is online booking the same as an online request?</strong><br />
            No. A request still needs staff to manually confirm. Real online booking writes a reservation instantly, enforces rules, and takes payment or a deposit.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Will deposits scare clients away?</strong><br />
            With clear, fair rules and instant confirmations, most owners accept deposits as normal. You can keep deposits flexible on non-peak days to reduce friction.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What about multi-dog households?</strong><br />
            Book them together on one reservation with per-dog fan-out for operations. Capacity decrements per kennel type must account for conjoined runs when needed.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Can staff override capacity?</strong><br />
            Yes, if your policy allows. Require a manager role and log the override with a reason. Overrides should be rare and visible on reports.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is it hard to migrate?</strong><br />
            Start by opening online booking for a subset of services or days. Run old and new workflows in parallel for two weeks, then fully switch.
