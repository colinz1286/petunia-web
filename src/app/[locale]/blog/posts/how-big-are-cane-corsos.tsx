          <p className="mb-4">
            Cane Corsos are large, muscular guardian dogs. Typical adult males land roughly in the <strong>95–120 lb</strong> range (43–54 kg) and females
            in the <strong>85–110 lb</strong> range (39–50 kg), with heights around <strong>24–28 inches at the shoulder</strong> depending on registry and lines. Growth is rapid
            through the first year and continues to fill out until two to three years. Large size means <strong>higher food costs</strong>, <strong>bigger gear</strong>, and
            potentially <strong>more expensive surgeries</strong> than for small breeds. The most important lever you control is <strong>lean body condition</strong>: it protects
            joints, lowers lifetime costs, and keeps energy steady.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Store monthly side/top/rear photos in Petunia with weight and a 1–5 appetite/energy note. Trends—not single weigh-ins—tell
            the truth about growth and adult maintenance.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Breed standards describe a powerful, athletic mastiff. International standards (FCI) list adult heights roughly in the <strong>23.5–26 inches</strong>
            (60–66 cm) range for females and <strong>25–27.5 inches</strong> (64–70 cm) for males, with typical adult weights around <strong>40–50 kg</strong> (88–110 lb) depending on
            sex and condition. In North America, many family Corsos finish in the mid-to-upper 90s for females and 100s for males, with outliers
            above or below. Remember: <em>numbers are averages</em>, not goals. Your individual dog’s structure and metabolism drive a healthy target.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Head and chest:</strong> broad skull, solid jaw, deep ribcage; mass is carried up front.</li>
            <li><strong>Muscle:</strong> even a lean Corso looks thick compared to many large breeds; fat adds harmful, hidden load.</li>
            <li><strong>Stride:</strong> efficient trot with easy drive; stiffness or bunny-hopping suggests joint or soft tissue strain.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Day-to-day reality: a big bed, a bigger crate, sturdy bowls, a front-clip harness for leverage, and mindful doorways and stairs.
            Planning for size turns power into calm, safe companionship.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Growth &amp; Weight by Age: Puppies → Seniors</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Growth patterns vary, but most Corsos follow a predictable curve: <strong>rapid skeletal growth to ~10–12 months</strong>, then <strong>gradual filling out</strong>
            of muscle and chest until <strong>24–36 months</strong>. The goal is <strong>steady, lean growth</strong>, not maximal speed. Excess calories or calcium do not create
            a stronger dog; they create heavier load on developing joints.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Typical weight touchpoints (very rough, individuals vary)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>8–10 weeks:</strong> 15–25 lb (7–11 kg). New-home period. Expect fast weekly changes.</li>
            <li><strong>4 months:</strong> 35–55 lb (16–25 kg). Limbs look long; coordination is catching up.</li>
            <li><strong>6 months:</strong> 55–80 lb (25–36 kg). Adolescence begins; manage arousal and stairs.</li>
            <li><strong>9 months:</strong> 70–95 lb (32–43 kg). Many females slow; males keep climbing.</li>
            <li><strong>12 months:</strong> 80–105 lb (36–48 kg). Height close to adult; chest will broaden.</li>
            <li><strong>18–24 months:</strong> 85–115 lb (39–52 kg). Muscle and head mature; find adult maintenance calories.</li>
            <li><strong>24–36 months:</strong> 90–120+ lb (41–54+ kg). Final fill for many lines.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Outliers happen. Smaller-framed Corsos exist and are often wonderful companions. The correct target is the <strong>healthiest body condition</strong>
            for your dog’s structure and activity—not a number someone posted online.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Senior weight trends</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            After eight years, many large dogs lose muscle if activity drops. Monitor <strong>muscle condition score</strong> (MCS) in addition to body fat. Keep
            walks frequent and short, add simple strength holds, and adjust calories to preserve lean mass without adding fat.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Body Condition Beats the Scale: How to Judge Healthy Size</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            A healthy Corso carries <strong>visible waist</strong> from above, a gentle <strong>abdominal tuck</strong> from the side, and <strong>easily felt ribs</strong> under a thin fat layer.
            On a 9-point body condition scale, the sweet spot is typically <strong>4–5/9</strong>. Over 6/9 adds real orthopedic load and can shorten healthy
            lifespan across breeds. Photograph side/top/rear every month and compare.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Coat can fool you:</strong> slick the hair back when feeling ribs.</li>
            <li><strong>Chest is not fat:</strong> Corsos are deep-chested; judge fat over the ribs and waist, not the sternum.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision scales:</strong> weigh at the vet or a pet store; home scale with you holding the dog is fine for puppies.</li>
          </ul>

        {/* Feeding amounts */}
        <section id="feeding" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How Much Food Do Cane Corsos Eat?</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Feeding is math plus observation. Start with energy needs, then tune every two weeks based on the scale and photos. A common
            starting point is <strong>Resting Energy Requirement (RER)</strong> and an activity multiplier. Your veterinarian can refine this, but a simple path is:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>RER (kcal/day) ≈ 70 × (body weight in kg<sup>0.75</sup>)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily calories ≈ RER × factor</strong> (growth, adult maintenance, senior). For many adult household Corsos, factors around <strong>1.2–1.6</strong> are
              common; growing puppies often <strong>2.0–3.0</strong> depending on stage. Always personalize.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Example (adult, 100 lb / 45 kg, moderate activity)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            RER ≈ 70 × 45<sup>0.75</sup> ≈ 70 × 17.3 ≈ <strong>1,211 kcal</strong>. Multiply by 1.4 (example factor) ≈ <strong>1,695 kcal/day</strong>. If your chosen food provides
            380 kcal/cup, that is roughly <strong>4.5 cups/day</strong> split into meals. If weight creeps up, reduce by 10 percent and re-check in two weeks.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Puppies</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Use large-breed puppy or appropriate all-life-stage food with correct calcium/phosphorus. Feed measured meals, not free choice.
            Recalculate every two weeks; growth is not linear. Avoid overfeeding in growth spurts. Slow, lean growth protects joints.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Seniors</h3>
          <p>
            Older dogs may need <strong>fewer calories</strong> if activity declines, or <strong>more protein</strong> to preserve muscle. Track appetite, stool, and weight,
            and adjust with your veterinary team. Lean seniors move longer and feel better.
          </p>

        <section id="budget" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Feeding Budget: What It Really Costs Per Month</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Monthly cost depends on calories needed, calories per cup, bag size, and bag price. Here is a simple framework you can adapt.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Step-by-step meal math (example)</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Pick a realistic daily calorie target (example adult: <strong>1,700 kcal</strong>).</li>
            <li>Find calories per cup on the bag (example: <strong>380 kcal/cup</strong>).</li>
            <li>Daily cups ≈ 1,700 ÷ 380 ≈ <strong>4.5 cups/day</strong>.</li>
            <li>Monthly cups ≈ 4.5 × 30 ≈ <strong>135 cups</strong>.</li>
            <li>Bag contains 30 lb at 120 kcal/oz ≈ ~<strong>3,300–3,600 kcal</strong> total (varies widely). Many bags list total kcal; use that for accuracy.</li>
            <li>Bags per month ≈ total monthly kcal ÷ kcal per bag.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-3">
            In practice, many 90–110 lb Corsos eat <strong>1 to 2 large bags/month</strong> depending on brand energy density and activity. If a bag is USD 60–110,
            a common monthly range is roughly <strong>USD 60–220</strong> for kibble alone. Add treats, toppers, and supplements if you use them.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Photograph the feeding label and your exact measuring cup. Portion drift is real. Recheck amounts every two weeks using weight
            and body photos—not the scoop you wish were correct.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Insurance converts financial volatility into a monthly line item. Large-breed premiums vary by age, region, and plan design, but
            many owners pay roughly <strong>USD 40–120/month</strong>. Plans usually have deductibles and reimbursement percentages and exclude pre-existing
            conditions. Owners who automate savings into a dedicated pet account can self-insure if they are disciplined and can cover a
            <strong> USD 3,000–7,000</strong> event without stress.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Insurance is worth a close look if a single large surgery would be hard to fund quickly.</li>
            <li>Savings plus prevention works if you contribute consistently and monitor risk factors.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How big will my Cane Corso get?</strong><br />
            Most females finish in the mid 80s to low 100s (lb) and males in the mid 90s to 120s, with individual variation. Genetics, diet, and
            activity shape the final picture. Use body condition, not internet brag weights, to set goals.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is heavier better?</strong><br />
            No. Extra fat stresses joints and can shorten healthy years. A lean, athletic 95 lb Corso is healthier than a soft 115 lb dog with the
            same bones. Muscle is earned with movement; fat is just load.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How much does food cost per month?</strong><br />
            Many adult Corsos eat roughly one to two large bags per month depending on brand energy density and activity, often in the USD 60–220
            range for kibble alone. Do the math for your calories and bag kcal to be precise.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is a 42&quot; crate enough?</strong><br />
            Some smaller females fit 42&quot; comfortably. Many adults need 48&quot; to stretch and turn with ease. Measure nose-to base-of-tail and floor-to-ear
            tips and compare to manufacturer guidance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Why do surgery costs vary so much?</strong><br />
            Region, hospital type, surgeon, equipment, and case complexity all matter. Larger dogs may require more anesthesia and consumables.
            Prevention and early intervention are the cheapest paths across a lifespan.
