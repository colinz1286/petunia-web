          <p className="mb-4">
            The best dog for you is the one whose daily needs and lifetime risks fit your real life. Map five constraints first: time, space, energy, grooming, and budget. Choose temperament before looks. Shortlists come from verified health screening, realistic exercise needs, coat care you can sustain, and a budget that covers preventive care plus emergencies.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> In the app, add a note titled &quot;Dog Fit Profile&quot; and store your answers to the checklists below. If a rescue, shelter, or breeder asks about lifestyle fit, you can share specifics quickly and avoid mismatches.

        <section id="fit-mindset" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How to Think About Fit</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Fit is not about a perfect breed; it is about a dog whose predictable traits align with your day to day reality. Dogs vary within any breed, yet the original purpose of a breed still informs common tendencies such as stamina, prey drive, sociability, and grooming load. Build your decision around repeatable daily behaviors you can deliver for years, not a single weekend vibe.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Predictability beats aesthetics:</strong> Coat color and viral popularity do not walk themselves or pay vet bills. Select for temperament and care needs you can meet.</li>
            <li><strong>Systems over motivation:</strong> A realistic routine, budget envelope, and training plan will carry you farther than bursts of enthusiasm.</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence over myths:</strong> Verify health claims and &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; marketing against authoritative veterinary sources.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Big Five */}
        <section id="big-five" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Big Five Constraints</h2>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">1) Time</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Dogs need daily care windows for exercise, training, play, feeding, and elimination. Puppies and adolescents require multiple short sessions spread across the day; adults do better with consistent blocks. If your workdays are long, plan for dog walkers, daycare, or help from family to protect the dog&apos;s welfare and your sanity.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">2) Space</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Square footage matters less than access to safe, regular movement and enrichment. Many small, athletic dogs need more exercise than large couch companions. Apartments can be great with a tight routine and good sound management for neighbors.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">3) Energy</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Match a dog&apos;s drive to your bandwidth for daily activity and training. Working and herding types often need structured outlets that are as mental as they are physical. If you dislike brisk weather or late-night walks, favor moderate-energy companions or breeds developed for easy home life.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">4) Grooming</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Coat types come with commitments: brushing cadence, professional grooming cycles, and seasonal sheds. A low-shedding coat can require intensive salon work, while a shedding coat may be DIY-friendly with consistent brushing and bathing.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">5) Budget</h3>
          <p>
            Budget for preventive care, food, grooming, training, and emergencies. Pet insurance can smooth volatility; self-insurance via a savings buffer is also useful. Build costs into your monthly plan before you choose the dog.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Temperament & Trainability */}
        <section id="temperament" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Temperament &amp; Trainability</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Temperament is the everyday feel of life with a dog: sociability, resilience, startle recovery, energy rhythms, and how a dog responds to guidance. Trainability is a mix of biddability and reward interest. Choose lines known for steady nerves and easy reinforcement strategies if your household is busy or you are new to training.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>New owners:</strong> Favor calm, people-focused dogs that enjoy food and play rewards and recover quickly from novelty.</li>
            <li><strong>Noise &amp; neighbors:</strong> Select for low vocalization and stable startle if you share walls.</li>
            <li><strong>Enthusiasts:</strong> If you love training sports, pick dogs with strong reinforcement histories and hobbies you enjoy such as scentwork, rally, or agility.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Age choice */}
        <section id="age-choice" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Puppy vs Adolescent vs Adult vs Senior</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Age changes daily life. Puppies offer a clean slate and high workload. Adolescents can feel like a roller coaster as brains mature. Adults are more predictable and often a great fit for busy families. Seniors are calm companions with medical needs that you can plan for.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Puppy:</strong> House training, socialization windows, frequent naps, lots of short training.</li>
            <li><strong>Adolescent:</strong> Physical energy spikes and boundary testing; double down on consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Adult:</strong> Known temperament; often easier integration into routines.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior:</strong> Gentle pace; budget for age-related care and adapt home layouts for comfort.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Size & housing */}
        <section id="size-housing" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Size &amp; Housing Compatibility</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Size affects access, transport, and care logistics. Tiny dogs can thrive in small spaces but may be fragile around toddlers. Giant dogs can be calm but require strength for handling, larger crates, higher food budgets, and vehicles with safe loading height. In rentals, verify pet policies and realistic noise management before selecting a vocal or high-energy companion.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Coats & allergy */}
        <section id="coat-allergy" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Coats, Shedding, &amp; Allergy Reality</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            No breed is truly allergen-free. The major dog allergen is Can f 1, present in dander and saliva. Some low-shedding coats may help with hair in the home, but they do not guarantee lower allergen load. If allergies are a concern, consult an allergist, trial contact with individual dogs, and build a cleaning protocol you can sustain.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-2">
            <li><strong>Shedding coats:</strong> Regular brushing and bathing can keep hair manageable with less salon time.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-shedding coats:</strong> Expect professional grooming every 4 to 8 weeks plus home brushing.</li>
            <li><strong>Allergy hygiene:</strong> HEPA filtration, bedroom-free zones, frequent laundry for dog beds, and hand-washing after play.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Avoid making a medical decision on marketing terms alone; verify with your medical team and real exposure trials.
          </p>

        {/* Health & screening */}
        <section id="health-screening" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Health Risks &amp; Screening</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Choose for health as much as for looks. Some breeds carry higher risks for specific conditions. Seek dogs from lines that complete recommended health tests and avoid extreme anatomy that compromises breathing or heat tolerance. Ask shelters and rescues for available medical history and follow up with your veterinarian soon after adoption.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Screening:</strong> Parent-club or OFA/CHIC recommendations help you verify hips, elbows, eyes, heart, and breed-specific DNA panels.</li>
            <li><strong>Anatomy:</strong> Short-muzzled dogs can struggle with heat and breathing; honest assessment protects welfare.</li>
            <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Life-table research can inform expectations by breed, though individual care and luck matter.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Budget */}
        <section id="budget" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Budget Math &amp; Insurance</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Build a first-year setup and a steady-state monthly budget. Include food, routine veterinary care, preventives, training, grooming, supplies, pet sitting or daycare if needed, and a reserve for emergencies. Insurance can offset volatility; confirm waiting periods and exclusions and compare two or three plans against your risk tolerance.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Quick benchmark:</strong> Industry data suggest average accident-and-illness premiums for dogs in the United States are in the mid-hundreds annually, with wide variation by breed, age, and location.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is there a single best family dog?</strong><br />
            No. Families differ in schedules, noise, space, energy, and support. Choose temperament and care requirements you can sustain for the dog&apos;s lifetime.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Are low-shedding dogs always better for allergies?</strong><br />
            Not necessarily. Hair management and allergy biology are different topics. Work with your medical team and test real exposure to individual dogs before deciding.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do mixed-breed dogs have fewer health problems?</strong><br />
            Mixed-breed and purebred dogs both benefit from preventive care and thoughtful selection. Health testing for known risks and avoiding extreme anatomy matter more than labels.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How much exercise does a dog need?</strong><br />
            It depends on age, health, and individual drive. Plan for daily movement and mental work; some dogs thrive on long hikes while others prefer steady neighborhood walks plus puzzle play.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Is pet insurance worth it?</strong><br />
            It can be valuable for unexpected costs. Compare quotes, read exclusions, and decide how you prefer to manage risk alongside a dedicated savings buffer.
