          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, Beagles shed—consistently throughout the year with seasonal increases in spring and fall. 
            Their short, dense coat requires weekly brushing, more during shedding seasons. 
            While not hypoallergenic, proper grooming, cleaning routines, and diet support can minimize hair around the home. 
            Families with mild allergies may still live comfortably with Beagles if proactive about coat care and cleaning.
          </p>

        <section id="overview" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Beagle Breed Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Beagles are small to medium-sized scent hounds, originally bred for hunting rabbits and hare. 
            With their keen nose, playful personality, and friendly temperament, they rank among the most popular family dogs worldwide. 
            Their short, weather-resistant double coat protects them outdoors but also contributes to year-round shedding.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="shedding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Do Beagles Shed?</h2>
          <p>
            The simple answer: yes. Beagles shed moderately to heavily, depending on the season and individual genetics. 
            Unlike some breeds with long coats, Beagles’ short hair may seem less noticeable, but it can spread across furniture, clothing, and floors quickly due to its density.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beagle owners should expect consistent shedding and prepare for a grooming routine that manages it effectively.
          </p>

        <section id="patterns" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Shedding Patterns Throughout the Year</h2>
          <p>
            Beagles have a <strong>double coat</strong>: a soft undercoat for insulation and a coarser topcoat for weather protection. 
            This combination leads to <strong>year-round shedding</strong> with noticeable seasonal “blowouts.”
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Heavy shedding as the winter coat is replaced with a lighter summer coat.</li>
            <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Another shedding surge as the summer coat makes way for a thicker winter coat.</li>
            <li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Light to moderate shedding occurs continuously, though it may be less intense outside of seasonal changes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Indoor Beagles exposed to artificial heating and cooling may shed more evenly throughout the year instead of following strict seasonal cycles.

        <section id="grooming" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Grooming Routines for Beagles</h2>
          <p>
            While Beagles’ coats are low-maintenance compared to long-haired breeds, consistent grooming is essential. 
            Weekly brushing reduces loose hair, spreads natural oils, and minimizes shedding in the home.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Brush weekly:</strong> Use a bristle brush or rubber curry mitt to capture loose hairs.</li>
            <li><strong>During shedding seasons:</strong> Brush several times a week to keep hair under control.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> Bathe once every 4–6 weeks with mild shampoo to avoid skin dryness.</li>
            <li><strong>Ears:</strong> Regularly clean ears, as Beagles are prone to ear infections due to their floppy ears.</li>
            <li><strong>Nails:</strong> Trim regularly; long nails affect posture and may contribute to uneven coat wear.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Proper grooming doesn’t just reduce shedding—it supports overall coat and skin health.
          </p>

        <section id="allergies" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Allergy Considerations for Families</h2>
          <p>
            Beagles are <strong>not hypoallergenic</strong>. Allergies are caused by proteins in dander, saliva, and urine—not just fur. 
            Because Beagles shed frequently, they release dander consistently into the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Families with mild allergies may still do well with Beagles if proactive:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Brush outdoors to prevent loose hair spreading indoors</li>
            <li>Use HEPA air purifiers to capture allergens</li>
            <li>Wash bedding and blankets weekly</li>
            <li>Restrict the dog from bedrooms</li>
            <li>Shower or wash hands after handling the dog</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Severe allergy sufferers may find Beagles challenging, but many families manage successfully with proper cleaning and medical allergy support.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Household Tips for Managing Shedding</h2>
          <p>
            Living with a Beagle doesn’t mean accepting a hairy home. Strategic cleaning routines can keep your house comfortable:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Invest in a vacuum with strong pet hair attachments</li>
            <li>Use washable slipcovers on couches and chairs</li>
            <li>Lint rollers and pet hair removers for clothing</li>
            <li>Place washable rugs in high-traffic areas</li>
            <li>Feed a balanced diet with omega-3 fatty acids for coat health</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A proactive approach makes a significant difference in managing Beagle hair around the home.

        <section id="health" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">When Shedding Might Signal a Health Issue</h2>
          <p>
            Normal shedding is expected, but excessive or patchy hair loss can indicate medical problems:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Allergies (environmental or food-related)</li>
            <li>Parasites like fleas or mites</li>
            <li>Thyroid disease or hormonal imbalances</li>
            <li>Skin infections or hot spots</li>
            <li>Poor nutrition</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If shedding seems unusual, consult a veterinarian to rule out underlying conditions.

        <section id="boarding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boarding and Daycare Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Beagles do well in daycare environments thanks to their friendly, social nature. However, staff should be aware of their consistent shedding. 
            Facilities may encourage owners to keep grooming routines up-to-date to minimize hair buildup in play areas. 
            Packing grooming wipes or requesting staff brush during long stays can help.

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Beagles shed—a lot. But with the right grooming, cleaning, and preventive care, their shedding is manageable. 
            They remain one of the most family-friendly breeds, known for their cheerful disposition and adaptability. 
            For households prepared to commit to coat care and cleaning routines, the joy of living with a Beagle far outweighs the inconvenience of stray hairs.
