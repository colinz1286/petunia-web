          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Boston Terriers shed moderately despite their short coats. They are not hypoallergenic,
            and their sensitive skin makes grooming important. Regular brushing, bathing with
            mild shampoo, dietary support, and cleaning routines reduce hair and dander at home.
            Skin conditions like allergies and dermatitis are common and require veterinary care
            if symptoms persist.
          </p>

        <section id="overview" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boston Terrier Coat Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Boston Terriers are often called the “American Gentleman” thanks to their tuxedo-like
            coat markings. Their coat is short, sleek, and fine-textured, making grooming
            relatively simple compared to long-haired breeds. However, their skin is sensitive,
            and they are prone to certain dermatological issues that owners must monitor closely.
          </p>

        <section id="shedding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Do Boston Terriers Shed?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes—Boston Terriers do shed. While their hair is short and may seem less noticeable,
            they shed year-round, with slightly higher amounts during spring and fall.
            Their fine hairs can embed themselves in fabrics, clothing, and carpets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to double-coated breeds, Boston Terriers are moderate shedders, but owners
            should not expect a completely “low-shed” or “hypoallergenic” dog.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Grooming Routines and Best Practices</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> Use a rubber curry brush once or twice a week to remove loose hair.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> Bathe every 4–6 weeks using a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrinkle care:</strong> Clean facial folds regularly to prevent bacteria buildup.</li>
            <li><strong>Nail trimming:</strong> Keep nails short to avoid posture and gait issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Ear cleaning:</strong> Check weekly for debris and wax buildup.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Grooming sessions are also a chance to check for lumps, hot spots, or irritated patches
            that may indicate allergies or skin conditions.

        <section id="allergies" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Allergy Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Boston Terriers are <strong>not hypoallergenic</strong>. Their shedding spreads dander,
            a common allergen. Families with allergies should prepare with proactive cleaning:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Use HEPA air purifiers in main living spaces</li>
            <li>Wash bedding and blankets weekly</li>
            <li>Vacuum regularly with pet-specific filters</li>
            <li>Restrict bedroom access if allergies are severe</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some Bostons also suffer from environmental allergies themselves, which can cause
            itching, redness, and frequent licking of paws.

        <section id="skin" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Skin Health and Common Issues</h2>
          <p>
            Boston Terriers are known for sensitive skin. Common issues include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Dermatitis:</strong> Skin inflammation from allergies or irritants.</li>
            <li><strong>Mange:</strong> Mite-related skin condition causing itching and hair loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Yeast infections:</strong> Common in warm, moist areas like skin folds.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot spots:</strong> Painful, moist lesions from excessive licking or scratching.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Preventive care includes gentle shampoos, avoiding harsh chemicals, and a diet
            that supports skin health. Veterinary advice is essential for persistent or severe cases.

        <section id="diet" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Diet and Supplements for a Healthy Coat</h2>
          <p>
            A balanced diet rich in fatty acids promotes a shiny coat and reduces shedding.
            Supplements that benefit Boston Terriers include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil)</li>
            <li>Omega-6 fatty acids for skin barrier health</li>
            <li>Vitamin E for antioxidant protection</li>
            <li>High-quality protein sources for strong hair follicles</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Consult a veterinarian before adding supplements, especially for dogs with existing
            medical conditions.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Household Cleaning Tips</h2>

            Even with short coats, Boston Terrier hair finds its way into every corner.
            Helpful tips include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Vacuum frequently with a pet hair attachment</li>
            <li>Use lint rollers on furniture and clothes</li>
            <li>Wash slipcovers and rugs regularly</li>

        <section id="boarding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boarding and Daycare Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Boston Terriers typically do well in daycare and boarding environments, but facilities
            should be aware of their sensitive skin and allergy risks. Staff should monitor for
            excessive scratching, and owners should disclose any special shampoos or medications.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Boston Terriers may be low-maintenance compared to long-haired breeds, but their
            coat and skin care needs are unique. Shedding, allergy considerations, and skin
            sensitivities mean owners must commit to regular grooming, proactive cleaning,
            and veterinary checkups. With proper care, Boston Terriers remain charming,
            healthy companions for many years.
