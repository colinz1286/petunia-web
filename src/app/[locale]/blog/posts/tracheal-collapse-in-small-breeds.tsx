          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Short Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Tracheal collapse</strong> is a structural weakness of the windpipe that leads to a classic <strong>&quot;goose-honk&quot; cough</strong>, especially in excited or warm conditions. Many small dogs do well long-term with <strong>weight control</strong>, a <strong>front-clip harness</strong>, cool/quiet spaces, and <strong>vet-guided anti-tussives</strong> and other medications. Severe, refractory cases may benefit from <strong>interventional stenting</strong> or surgery under a specialist, with careful risk-benefit discussion. The most powerful tools are the boring ones: lower body weight, fewer cough triggers, and consistent routines.
          </p>

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Turn this into your dog&#39;s airway <em>care SOP</em>—harness type and fit photos, weight target, room temp limits, medication schedule, and a cough-spike plan with ER numbers.

        <section id="what-it-is" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What Tracheal Collapse Is (Plain-Language)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            The canine trachea is a flexible tube made of C-shaped cartilage rings connected by a muscular membrane. In tracheal collapse, those rings weaken or flatten and the dorsal membrane may become lax, allowing the airway to narrow during breathing. Collapse can occur in the <strong>cervical</strong> (neck) portion, the <strong>intrathoracic</strong> portion (inside the chest), or both. Because airway pressures differ between inhalation and exhalation, some dogs cough more on inspiration, others on expiration, and some on both.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">
            While alarming to hear, many dogs with mild to moderate collapse are <strong>comfortable and active</strong> when owners control triggers and follow a consistent medical plan. Your job is to lower the &quot;load&quot; on the windpipe—less pulling, less heat, less weight, less chaos—and to have a priority path for bad days.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Tracheal collapse is seen most often in <strong>toy and small breeds</strong>: Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, Toy Poodles, Pugs, Shih Tzus, and Maltese are frequently listed. Age of onset varies—some dogs show signs in early adulthood; others present later with a lifetime of subtle coughing that worsens with weight gain or heat.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-0">
            <li><strong>Body weight:</strong> overweight dogs cough more and recover slower.</li>
            <li><strong>Neck pressure:</strong> collar pulling can trigger cough fits; switch to harness.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat &amp; humidity:</strong> warm, sticky days worsen panting and airway collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Air irritants:</strong> smoke, aerosols, heavy perfumes, dust.</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrent disease:</strong> dental disease, airway infections, heart enlargement can amplify cough.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Symptoms &amp; Common Triggers</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            The hallmark is a harsh, resonant cough many owners describe as a <strong>&quot;goose-honk&quot;</strong>. Episodes can be brief or last minutes, and often follow leash pulling, excitement at the door, barking at windows, inhaled irritants, or hot car transitions. Some dogs gag or retch at the end of a bout; others have noisy breathing (stridor) or wheeze.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Typical Triggers</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Leash pressure on a neck collar; sudden pulling.</li>
            <li>Heat/humidity; exercise right after a meal.</li>
            <li>Excited barking at visitors or doorbells.</li>
            <li>Dusty rooms, cigarette or vape smoke, strong cleaning sprays.</li>
            <li>Pressure from tight grooming loops or muzzles.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-0">
            Persistent cyanosis (blue tongue), collapse, or sharp increases in effort are <strong>not</strong> normal and require emergency assessment.

        {/* DIAGNOSIS */}
        <section id="diagnosis" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Diagnosis &amp; Grading</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Vets diagnose by combining <strong>history</strong> and <strong>exam</strong> with imaging. Standard radiographs can show narrowed tracheal diameter, though collapse can be intermittent. Dynamic fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray), airway endoscopy, and ultrasound of the neck are used in selected cases. Endoscopy allows grading of collapse, assessment of the larynx and bronchi, and collection of samples if infection is suspected.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">
            Many clinicians use a <strong>grade 1–4</strong> scheme (mild to severe). Treatment plans scale with grade and with clinical impact: some grade-2 dogs cough rarely; some grade-1 dogs cough often because of triggers or weight.

            <li>Short, frequent walks during cool hours; avoid heavy play in heat.</li>
            <li>Pause after excitement; let breathing settle before activity or meals.</li>
            <li>Teach <strong>calm-on-cue</strong> behaviors (mat settle, hand target) to defuse doorbell arousal.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Weight &amp; Harness Strategy: The Biggest Wins</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Even small weight losses reduce airway load and heat stress. Aim for a <strong>lean body condition</strong> (ribs easily felt with light cover). Feed measured grams, trim calorie-dense treats, and use puzzle feeders that don&#39;t spike arousal. Pair weight control with a <strong>front-clip harness</strong> sized and adjusted for your dog. A comfortable harness converts pulling into shoulder guidance rather than neck compression.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-0">
            <li>Reweigh every two to four weeks; adjust portions by grams, not scoops.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Medication plans are individualized. Many dogs need them only during seasonal flares or stressful periods; others benefit from longer courses. Work closely with your veterinarian and never share human cough meds without guidance.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Commonly Used Options</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Anti-tussives</strong> (cough suppressants) to break the cough cycle and reduce airway irritation.</li>
            <li><strong>Bronchodilators</strong> for lower airway contribution or concurrent bronchitis (case dependent).</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-inflammatories</strong> (including brief steroid courses when indicated) to reduce mucosal swelling.</li>
            <li><strong>Sedatives/anxiolytics</strong> in carefully chosen situations to limit panic-driven cough fits.</li>
            <li><strong>Antibiotics</strong> only if infection is documented or strongly suspected; they are not routine.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Nebulization &amp; Humidification</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Some vets recommend <strong>nebulization</strong> (moist air) or saline inhalation to soothe airways, especially during dry winter months. Avoid over-humidifying rooms—excess humidity can worsen breathing comfort in some dogs.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Dental disease inflames the oropharynx and can worsen cough. Ironically, dental care requires anesthesia, which can pose airway management challenges in dogs with collapse. Talk with your vet about <strong>pre-anesthetic planning</strong>: gentle induction, experienced anesthesia monitoring, and postoperative cough control. Proactive dental hygiene at home (brushing, VOHC-accepted chews under guidance) reduces the frequency of anesthetic events over a lifetime.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">

          <p className="mb-3">
            When diligent lifestyle control and medications are not enough, your vet may refer you to a specialist for advanced options. The two major paths are <strong>extratracheal ring prostheses</strong> (open surgery, most suited to cervical collapse) and <strong>intraluminal stenting</strong> (minimally invasive, commonly used for intrathoracic collapse or diffuse disease). Each has tradeoffs.

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Will my dog outgrow tracheal collapse?</strong><br />
            It is typically a chronic condition. Many dogs stabilize with weight control, harness use, and trigger management, and they enjoy excellent quality of life with periodic medical support.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is a collar ever okay?</strong><br />
            For ID tags, yes. For walking, use a harness. Even occasional pulling can set off prolonged cough fits.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Can I use human cough medicines?</strong><br />
            Only under veterinary guidance. Dosing and suitability vary, and some combinations are unsafe for dogs.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How do I pick between stent and surgery?</strong><br />
