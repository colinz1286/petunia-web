          California Dogs &amp; Tick-Borne Bacteria: Why Anaplasmosis Has Tripled
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
          A Los Angeles Times report found that the share of California dogs testing positive for the bacterium that
          causes anaplasmosis has nearly tripled in recent years. This is more than a veterinary footnote—it signals a
          shifting tick landscape, overlapping disease risks, and practical changes owners and facilities should make
          now to reduce exposure.

              <li>California dogs show ~3× higher anaplasmosis exposure than a few years ago, per regional reporting.</li>
              <li>Ticks that transmit Anaplasma also transmit Lyme and other pathogens, so co-infections occur.</li>
              <li>Use year-round tick prevention, daily checks, and yard management; consistency matters more than brand.</li>

          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">What Is Anaplasmosis &amp; Why the Spike?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Anaplasmosis is a bacterial disease caused by <em>Anaplasma</em> species (commonly <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>).
            In dogs, signs can include fever, lethargy, joint pain, and, in some cases, bleeding issues; many exposed
            dogs are subclinical and only identified on screening tests.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Rising canine positives likely reflect multiple forces: warmer seasons that lengthen tick activity windows,
            urban expansion into wildlife corridors, increases in veterinary screening, and shifts in host populations
            like deer and small mammals. The net effect is simple—owners and operators should behave as if tick exposure
            risk is higher and more persistent than before.
          </p>

        <section id="overlap" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">Overlap: Lyme, Ehrlichia &amp; Co-Infections</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The same tick species that carry Anaplasma can also carry <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (Lyme), <em>Ehrlichia</em>,
            <em> Babesia</em>, and others. Co-infections complicate diagnosis and can intensify clinical signs. If your dog
            tests positive for any one tick-borne pathogen, ask your veterinarian about a panel that checks for the others.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="surveillance" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">Tick Surveillance &amp; Trends</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            National parasite councils and state agencies publish maps and annual forecasts that closely track real-world
            results. These tools help veterinarians and facilities anticipate seasonal spikes and regional hotspots so
            prevention policies can be tightened proactively rather than reactively.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Practical takeaway: monitor your county&rsquo;s advisories, and adjust your operations calendar—more frequent
            yard treatment and tighter screening during peak months, plus reminders to clients about prevention compliance.

            <li><strong>Year-round preventives:</strong> pick a vet-recommended product and stay on schedule without gaps.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily tick checks:</strong> focus on ears, around eyes, between toes, groin, and tail base; remove with a tick tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Yard management:</strong> mow, remove leaf litter, trim brush, and create gravel buffers near fence lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Trail choices:</strong> avoid tall grass edges in peak months; keep dogs on-path where possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathing &amp; rinse-offs:</strong> quick rinse after high-risk hikes helps dislodge unattached ticks.</li>

            <li><strong>Rotation &amp; rest:</strong> cycle yards and allow dwell time after treatment per label directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Staff training:</strong> teach early clinical signs, safe removal, and cleaning of tools between uses.</li>

            <summary className="cursor-pointer font-semibold">Can my dog pass anaplasmosis directly to people?</summary>
            <p className="mt-2">
              No. Dogs are sentinels for tick presence. People get infected from tick bites, not from their dogs.

          <details className="mb-3 rounded-lg border p-4">
            <summary className="cursor-pointer font-semibold">Is anaplasmosis treatable?</summary>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Yes. Most cases respond well to doxycycline or related antibiotics. Early detection improves outcomes.

          <details className="mb-3 rounded-lg border p-4">

            <p className="mt-2">
              In higher-risk regions, many veterinarians recommend annual screening panels that include Anaplasma, Lyme,
              and Ehrlichia. Your vet will tailor advice to your dog&rsquo;s exposure.
