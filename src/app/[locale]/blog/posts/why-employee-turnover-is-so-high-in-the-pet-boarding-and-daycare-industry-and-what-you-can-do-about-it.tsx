          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">TL;DR Summary</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Employee churn in pet boarding and daycare is driven by a predictable bundle of pressures: variable hours, seasonality, emotional labor,
            physically demanding work, safety stress, and the mismatch between responsibility and pay. Solving it does not require unlimited payroll.
            It requires tight systems: realistic job previews, competency-based onboarding, a simple pay ladder tied to verified skills, clear
            schedules, safe handling protocols, and trust-building leadership. When you install these systems, you cut early-tenure exits, stabilize
            the middle, and create a small but steady pipeline of future leads and managers.

          <p className="mb-3">
            In retail or restaurants, churn hurts. In pet care, churn hurts <em>and</em> elevates risk: handling anxious dogs, moving animals through
            gates, dosing meds correctly, watching group play, avoiding fights. New, untrained staff raise the probability of near-misses and the odds
            of service errors. That is why retention is not just a finance topic; it is a safety topic and a client-trust topic.
          </p>

            <li><strong>First-90-day exits:</strong> the canary in the coal mine. If this is high, your hiring preview and onboarding are misaligned.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenure distribution:</strong> how many teammates at 0‚Äì3 months, 3‚Äì12 months, 12+ months. Aim to grow the 12+ segment.</li>

            The reasons people leave boarding/daycare jobs look similar across regions. Owners who solve turnover accept these realities and build
            systems around them instead of fighting human nature.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Back-of-the-napkin numbers are enough to make good decisions. A front-line hire often costs several weeks of wages in recruiting,
            onboarding time, training shadow hours, uniforms, and the performance loss while they ramp. If they leave at six weeks, you absorb those
            costs and repeat. A modest, targeted retention spend (small raises tied to milestones, better schedules, training materials) is cheaper
            than replacing the same role multiple times per year.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Direct costs:</strong> job ads, interview time, background checks, onboarding pay, shadow hours, uniforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden costs:</strong> supervisor distraction, mistakes from inexperience, client refunds, morale drag on the veteran crew.</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> with a stable team, you can open more capacity on peak days and accept last-minute revenue instead of
              turning it away.</li>

        {/* FAQ */}
        <section id="faq" className="mb-16">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do I have to raise pay to keep people?</strong><br />
            Pay matters, but clarity and safety matter just as much. A modest ladder with transparent steps often beats a random raise because it feels
            fair, repeatable, and earned.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How fast can retention improve?</strong><br />
            You should see improvements in first-90-day exits within one or two months if you fix hiring and onboarding. Longer-tenure stability follows
            as your schedule and culture settle.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What about tough clients who burn out staff?</strong><br />
            Protect your team. Provide owners with education on realistic outcomes, and step in early when behavior crosses lines. A single relentlessly
            negative client can undo ten good hires.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How do I handle seasonal spikes?</strong><br />
            Recruit early with temporary offers tied to your ladder, pre-train on weekends, and assign a senior to run short ‚Äúseason drills‚Äù on safety,
            cleaning speed, and yard flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is this legal or HR advice?</strong><br />
            No. This is practical guidance. For wage, overtime, and compliance rules, consult your attorney or a qualified HR professional in your
            state or country.
