          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Great Danes are among the largest dog breeds, but their size comes with challenges:
            shorter lifespans (average 7–10 years), susceptibility to bloat, heart disease, joint
            issues, and cancer. Owners can support their Great Dane’s health with proper diet,
            controlled exercise, early veterinary screening, and a lifestyle tailored to giant
            breeds. Proactive care can improve both quality and length of life.
          </p>

        <section id="overview" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Breed Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Great Danes, often called “gentle giants,” are famous for their towering height and
            affectionate nature. Originally bred for hunting boar and guarding estates, today
            they are beloved family companions known for their loyalty and calm demeanor indoors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their sheer size—standing up to 32 inches at the shoulder and weighing 110–175 pounds—
            is impressive but also contributes to unique health concerns. Their rapid growth,
            heavy frames, and genetic predispositions create a need for specialized care.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="lifespan" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Great Danes Have Shorter Lifespans</h2>
          <p>
            The average Great Dane lives between 7–10 years, significantly shorter than smaller
            breeds that may reach 15–18 years. Research suggests that large dogs age faster due
            to accelerated growth and metabolic strain on organs. Simply put, their size is
            inversely related to their longevity.
          </p>
          <p>
            While genetics play a major role, proactive care can add years to a Great Dane’s life.
            Regular vet visits, early screenings, and lifestyle adjustments all make a measurable
            difference.

        <section id="common-issues" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Common Health Issues in Great Danes</h2>
          <p>
            Owners should be aware of the most frequent health concerns affecting Great Danes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus):</strong> A life-threatening emergency where the stomach twists, cutting off blood flow. Preventive surgery (gastropexy) is often recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Cardiomyopathy:</strong> Enlargement of the heart that weakens its ability to pump blood efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Hip Dysplasia and Arthritis:</strong> Joint issues due to rapid growth and heavy body weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Wobbler Syndrome:</strong> Neurological condition affecting the spine, causing weakness or unsteady gait.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancer:</strong> Bone cancers like osteosarcoma are more common in giant breeds.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Knowing these risks helps owners prioritize preventive measures and recognize early
            warning signs.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="diet" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Nutrition for a Giant Breed</h2>
          <p>
            Diet is one of the most critical aspects of Great Dane care. Improper feeding can
            increase the risk of bloat, skeletal issues, and obesity. Recommendations include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Puppy diet:</strong> Feed large-breed puppy food to slow growth and support joint health.</li>
            <li><strong>Meal frequency:</strong> Divide meals into 2–3 portions per day to reduce bloat risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Elevated bowls:</strong> Use cautiously—recent studies suggest mixed effects on bloat risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega-3s can support joint health.</li>
            <li><strong>Calorie control:</strong> Prevent obesity by feeding based on lean body mass, not appetite alone.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Fresh water should always be available, but avoid heavy activity right after meals to
            reduce the risk of bloat.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="exercise" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Exercise and Activity Needs</h2>
          <p>
            Great Danes require daily exercise, but it must be tailored to their size and age.
            Puppies should avoid excessive running or jumping to prevent joint damage. Adults
            thrive on moderate walks and play sessions rather than high-intensity activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Owners should provide:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Two 20–30 minute walks per day</li>
            <li>Gentle play in secure yards</li>
            <li>Mental enrichment through training and puzzle feeders</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overexertion increases the risk of orthopedic problems, while too little activity
            leads to obesity and muscle weakness.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="care" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Daily Care and Preventive Health</h2>
          <p>
            Supporting a Great Dane’s health involves a balance of preventive veterinary care
            and at-home monitoring:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Annual (or semi-annual for seniors) veterinary checkups</li>
            <li>Cardiac screenings starting in middle age</li>
            <li>Joint exams and x-rays for early detection of hip or spine issues</li>
            <li>Dental cleanings to prevent gum disease and secondary infections</li>
            <li>Weight monitoring to avoid excess stress on joints and heart</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Owners should also provide large, orthopedic beds to cushion joints and reduce
            pressure sores—a common issue in giant breeds.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="boarding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boarding and Daycare Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Boarding a Great Dane requires careful planning. Facilities must have enough space,
            strong fencing, and staff experienced with giant breeds. Key considerations include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Extra-large kennels or runs</li>
            <li>Soft bedding to support joints</li>
            <li>Calm playgroups with compatible dogs</li>
            <li>Staff trained to recognize signs of bloat or distress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Owners should provide clear feeding instructions and medication details, as routine
            management is critical to avoiding emergencies in this breed.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Great Danes are magnificent companions, but their health challenges require informed,
            proactive care. From managing diet and exercise to monitoring for heart and joint
            disease, every step matters in extending their lifespan. While they may not live as
            long as smaller breeds, with the right support, Great Danes can enjoy full, happy lives
            as beloved family members. Their loyalty and gentle presence make every moment with them
            deeply rewarding.
