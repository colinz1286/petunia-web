          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Short Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Vaccination tracking with proactive alerts is not a nice-to-have feature in dog boarding &amp; dog daycare software—it is the backbone of safe intake, outbreak prevention, and audit-ready operations. The right system centralizes vaccine records, standardizes policy rules, blocks risky bookings automatically, and nudges owners long before expirations. Facilities that implement this well see fewer last-minute cancellations, smoother check-ins, stronger client trust, and better occupancy because the calendar is not derailed by preventable compliance gaps.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Tie alerts to <em>events</em> (expiration windows, bookings, waitlists) and <em>people</em> (primary owner, secondary contact). Send a friendly nudge at 30/14/7 days pre-expiry and a final reminder 72 hours before the reservation window closes. Friendly automation prevents tense front-desk conversations.

        {/* Why It Matters */}
        <section id="why" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Vaccination Tracking Matters for Boarding &amp; Daycare</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Every facility lives at the intersection of three realities: biology, regulation, and customer service. Infectious disease does not care about your Friday capacity; a single gap—one unverified Bordetella or lapsed DHPP—can force quarantines, refunds, and review-site headaches. At the same time, most owners are not trying to skirt rules; they simply forget, misremember dates, or assume their vet will fax something &quot;on time.&quot; Software bridges this gap by making the right thing the easy thing: clear requirements, smooth uploads, one source of truth, and polite nudges before compliance becomes an emergency.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Health &amp; safety:</strong> Reduce the likelihood and scale of outbreaks by keeping immunity status current across the population.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Many jurisdictions and partners expect proof of core vaccines; clean logs protect your license and reputation.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational flow:</strong> Avoid day-of surprises, bottlenecks at check-in, and labor spent chasing paperwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust &amp; marketing:</strong> &quot;We verify vaccines for every dog&quot; is a powerful promise. Back it with automation.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Vaccine Basics */}
        <section id="vaccine-basics" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Vaccine Basics: Core vs Non-Core (High-Level)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Terminology and timing vary by country, veterinary body, and individual risk profile. In broad strokes, facilities commonly require:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Core</strong> (examples): DHPP/DA2PP (distemper, adenovirus/hepatitis, parvovirus ± parainfluenza), and rabies per local law.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-core but frequently required by facilities:</strong> Bordetella (kennel cough) and, increasingly, canine influenza in certain regions or during outbreaks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Schedules differ (1-year vs 3-year rabies protocols, intranasal vs injectable Bordetella with different booster windows, local influenza requirements). A good software system does not hard-code global rules; it stores <em>your</em> policy, adds regional toggles, and keeps proof on file for each dog.
          </p>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Model each vaccine as its own object with fields like <code>name</code>, <code>required</code>, <code>minDaysBeforeBooking</code>, <code>graceDays</code>, <code>renewalCycle</code> (e.g., 1y, 3y, 6m), <code>proofFiles</code>, <code>verifiedBy</code>, <code>verifiedAt</code>. This supports precise enforcement and clean audits.
          </div>
        </section>

        {/* Policy */}
        <section id="policy" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Policy Design &amp; Regional Nuance</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            You want a policy that is medically sensible, operationally realistic, and easy to communicate. Because your clientele may span cities or border areas, build in regional nuance rather than endless exceptions at the front desk.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Decisions to make up front</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Which vaccines are required for daycare vs boarding?</strong> Many facilities require Bordetella for group play but not for a quiet overnight &quot;solo&quot; option.</li>
            <li><strong>Lead times:</strong> Will you accept a Bordetella dose given &lt; 72 hours before arrival? Some vets advise a brief window before group exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Grace periods:</strong> Will you allow a 7-day grace if a renewal appointment is booked? Software can enforce a short, documented window.</li>
            <li><strong>Proof standards:</strong> PDF from the clinic portal? Photo of invoice? Upload + staff verification covers 95% of cases quickly.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Country &amp; jurisdiction notes</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Requirements around rabies and record retention differ across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Rather than pretend there is a universal law, your software should let you toggle jurisdictional settings per facility location (e.g., &quot;3-year rabies accepted&quot; vs &quot;1-year only,&quot; &quot;influenza required during regional alert&quot;). Save the setting itself so you can later justify why a dog was allowed or blocked on that date.
          </p>

        <section id="data-model" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Data Model: One Source of Truth</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Vaccine status should live with the dog, not inside scattered screenshots or per-reservation notes. When you centralize data by dog, every workflow—booking, check-in, grooming add-ons, staff views—reads from the same object and you avoid contradictions.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Dog profile object:</strong> species, DOB/age, sex/spay-neuter, allergies, meds, <em>vaccines[]</em> (array of vaccine objects), owner IDs, and flags (e.g., senior, medical hold).</li>
            <li><strong>Vaccine object:</strong> <code>type</code> (e.g., DHPP), <code>lastDoseAt</code>, <code>expiresAt</code>, <code>renewalCycle</code>, <code>proofFiles[]</code>, <code>verified</code> boolean, <code>verifiedBy</code>, <code>verifiedAt</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy object:</strong> versioned policy with required vaccines by service type, lead-time rules, grace days, and per-locale overrides.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Version your vaccine policy. When rules change (e.g., temporary influenza requirement), store <code>policyVersion</code> on each booking. That way, your audit can prove the dog met the rule <em>that applied on that date</em>.

          <p className="mb-3">
            The best alert system does two things: it prevents surprises and it prevents manual work. Owners should receive helpful nudges long before expiration; staff should only see true exceptions.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Group dynamics mean respiratory pathogens can spread quickly. Many facilities require Bordetella and keep a tighter renewal cadence. Because daycare is a higher-frequency service, automate renewals relentlessly—owners appreciate not having to &quot;remember the basics&quot; every month.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Stays are longer and arrivals are more deadline-driven (flights, weddings, holidays). Your alert logic should weight upcoming reservations more heavily and escalate sooner if a record is missing. Offer a &quot;Send to clinic&quot; request so the owner can authorize the vet to email proof directly to you.

            <strong>Do we need different rules for daycare vs boarding?</strong><br />
            Often yes. Many facilities require Bordetella for daycare group play and may set different lead-time rules for boarding arrivals. Software lets you separate policies by service type so staff do not juggle exceptions.

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What if an owner cannot find their records?</strong><br />

            In practice, predictable rules and early nudges <em>improve</em> occupancy. Cancellations drop, owners plan ahead, and your brand signals professionalism.

            <strong>How do we handle medical exemptions?</strong><br />
            Require a vet letter with an expiry date, store it on the dog profile, and restrict the dog from high-risk services if needed. Log every override with reason codes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Do we need to accept titers?</strong><br />
            That is a policy decision. If you allow titers, document standards clearly and store lab reports with a defined review cycle.
