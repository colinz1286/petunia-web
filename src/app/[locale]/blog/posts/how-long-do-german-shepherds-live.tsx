          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Most German Shepherds live around 10 years on average</strong>, with many reaching 11 to 13 when they maintain an ideal body
            condition, get structured exercise that protects joints, and receive consistent preventive veterinary care. The biggest
            levers you control are <strong>lean body weight</strong>, <strong>nutrition quality and portioning</strong>, <strong>lifelong fitness and joint protection</strong>,
            <strong> dental care</strong>, <strong>parasite prevention</strong>, and <strong>timely vet screening</strong>. Genetics matter, but daily habits move the needle.

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Store your GSD’s weight trend, BCS photos, exercise plan, and vet schedule in Petunia. Consistency across

          <p className="mb-3">
            Population studies in primary-care veterinary records report a <strong>median lifespan near 10.3 years</strong> for German Shepherd Dogs.
            That is typical for a large, athletic breed. Do not treat 10 as a ceiling. With proactive care, many individuals reach
            low teens with good quality of life.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Typical range:</strong> roughly 9 to 13 years, with tails on either side depending on genetics and care.</li>
            <li><strong>Common end-of-life drivers:</strong> musculoskeletal decline affecting mobility, cancers (including hemangiosarcoma),
              and multi-factor causes summarized by vets as inability to rise or stand.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthspan matters:</strong> the goal is more comfortable months doing normal dog things, not just more calendar days.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This guide focuses on what extends both <em>lifespan</em> and <em>healthspan</em> in real homes: weight control, food quality, smart
            exercise, dental health, prevention of parasites and GDV, and early detection of treatable issues.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Why lifespan varies */}
        <section id="why-it-varies" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why GSD Lifespan Varies So Much</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Two German Shepherds living on the same street can age very differently. Genetics set the slope of the curve; <em>management</em>
            shifts the curve. Here are the big drivers.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">1) Body size and joint load</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Larger dogs face higher mechanical stress on hips, elbows, and cruciate ligaments. Over time this can amplify arthritis and
            mobility decline. The lever you control is keeping a <strong>lean body condition</strong> so joints carry less work for every step.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">2) Genetics and breeding choices</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Hip and elbow dysplasia risk, spinal disease like degenerative myelopathy (DM), and some cancer predispositions vary with lines.
            Dogs from breeders who screen hips, elbows, and relevant DNA markers shift risk in your favor. That is not a guarantee, but it
            stacks the deck toward healthier aging.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">3) Reproductive timing</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Early spay/neuter before skeletal maturity is associated with higher rates of joint disorders in GSDs in some datasets. Work with
            your veterinarian on breeding-neutral, individualized timing that balances orthopedic risk with behavior, household management,
            pyometra or testicular cancer risk, and population control goals.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">4) Lifestyle: weight, diet, movement, sleep</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Chronic excess calories and low activity shorten canine lifespan across breeds. In contrast, portion control, protein-forward
            diets that meet AAFCO or FEDIAF profiles, and structured exercise patterns support joint health, body composition, and energy.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">5) Preventive medicine access</h3>
          <p>
            Annual and then twice-yearly senior visits, dental cleanings when indicated, parasite prevention, and baseline bloodwork catch
            problems early, when they are cheaper and easier to treat. That translates directly into more comfortable months together.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Evidence from long-term studies and clinical practice points to several practical levers that add up. You do not need a perfect
            routine. You need a repeatable one. Build these into your week and share the plan with every caregiver so it sticks.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Hold ideal body condition:</strong> ribs easy to feel without a thick fat pad; clear waist and abdominal tuck. Aim for a 9-point
              BCS of 4 or 5. Use a kitchen scale for food portions and weigh your dog monthly.</li>
            <li><strong>Feed complete, portioned meals:</strong> choose a food that meets current AAFCO or FEDIAF profiles for your dog’s life stage;
              measure to calories, not scoops; add water for hydration and satiety.</li>
            <li><strong>Program exercise:</strong> daily walks plus skill work, scent games, and strength routines that protect joints. Warm up and cool down.</li>
            <li><strong>Brush teeth and book cleanings:</strong> teeth brushing 4 to 7 days per week; professional cleanings as recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevent parasites:</strong> year-round heartworm prevention where indicated; tick and flea control based on regional risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Screen on a schedule:</strong> baseline labs in early adulthood, then annual; switch to every 6 months for seniors with trend
              tracking. Add imaging or specific tests based on risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan for GDV risk:</strong> know bloat signs and discuss prophylactic gastropexy at time of spay/neuter for at-risk individuals.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">
            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> In Petunia, create a repeatable weekly block: weigh, brush, nail check, ear check, plus 2 joint-friendly strength
            sessions. Attach videos so every caregiver copies the same motions.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Nutrition &amp; Body Condition: The Single Biggest Lifespan Lever</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            If you only optimize one thing, optimize body condition. Lean-fed dogs live longer in controlled research, and overweight status
            shortens lifespan in real-world datasets. For a large athlete like a GSD, removing 10 to 20 percent of excess weight can transform
            joint comfort and activity capacity within weeks.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Targets and tools</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>BCS goal:</strong> 4 to 5 on a 9-point scale. Keep monthly photos: side, top, rear. Trend in Petunia.</li>
            <li><strong>Calories:</strong> start at Resting Energy Requirement times an activity factor your vet recommends; adjust every 2 weeks based on
              the scale and BCS, not the bag chart.</li>
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> ensure adequate high-quality protein to support lean mass, especially in seniors and during weight loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Meal rhythm:</strong> feed measured meals, not free choice. Use slow feeders for enthusiasm. Hydrate kibble with warm water.</li>
            <li><strong>Treats:</strong> cap at 10 percent of daily calories. Use part of the measured ration for training.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> omega-3s from marine sources can help joints and coat; discuss dosing and product quality with your vet.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Weight loss plan (if BCS is 6 or higher)</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li>Weigh on the same scale weekly. Record weight, BCS, and a 10-second walk video.</li>
            <li>Reduce daily calories by 10 to 15 percent; switch to a veterinary weight management diet if hunger sabotages adherence.</li>
            <li>Add two extra 10-minute sniff walks per day and one 5-minute strength routine (sit-to-stand, cookie stretches).</li>
            <li>At 2 weeks, reassess; adjust calories by another 5 to 10 percent if there is no progress and your vet agrees.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            German Shepherds thrive on daily movement and mental work. The goal is a program that builds fitness while protecting joints so
            you can keep exercising into the senior years. Think pattern, not punishment: short, regular sessions beat weekend marathons.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">A weekly template you can start today</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Daily walks:</strong> 2 sessions of 20 to 40 minutes at a conversational pace; add hills or varied surfaces if joints allow.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength twice weekly:</strong> 5 to 8 minutes of controlled sit-to-stand sets, elevated stand holds, diagonal leg lifts, cookie
              stretches, and cavaletti poles at low height.</li>
            <li><strong>Cardio bursts:</strong> 2 to 3 short fetch or tug sets with full recovery between; stop before fatigue changes gait or enthusiasm.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind work:</strong> 10 minutes of nosework searches or trick training on non-strength days.</li>
            <li><strong>Warm up and cool down:</strong> 3 to 5 minutes of easy walking at the start and end; towel dry and inspect paws and nails.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Protecting hips, elbows, and cruciates</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Avoid repetitive ball throwing on slick surfaces and uncontrolled stair sprints. Build symmetry: equal turns, both directions over
            poles, and flat figure-eights. If your dog shows intermittent lameness, reluctance to jump into the car, or bunny-hopping at the
            trot, pause the athletic work and book a vet exam.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Genetics &amp; Screening: Hips, Elbows, DM, and EPI</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            You cannot pick your dog’s parents after the fact, but you can work with what you have. Baseline exams and targeted screening
            give you early options and a clearer exercise plan.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Hips and elbows</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Hip and elbow dysplasia are common orthopedic issues in GSDs. If you plan athletic sports or your dog has chronic stiffness,
            discuss imaging. For breeders and working prospects, hip and elbow evaluations through established schemes are standard.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Degenerative myelopathy (DM)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            DM is a late-onset spinal cord disease associated with SOD1 variants in many breeds. Affected dogs develop progressive hind
            limb ataxia and weakness in later life. DNA testing cannot predict with certainty that disease will occur, but it informs breeding
            and can guide monitoring for early mobility support.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            EPI is overrepresented in GSDs. Classic signs are weight loss despite a ravenous appetite and large-volume stool. If suspected,
            your vet can run a TLI test and begin pancreatic enzyme replacement and cobalamin support. Treated dogs can live full lives.

          <p className="mb-3">
            At 8 years and older, switch to a senior cadence: shorter sessions, more recovery, and tighter medical monitoring. Keep minds
            busy with scent games, puzzle feeders, and calm social time. Add traction runners and ramps at home.

            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> add low-impact hydrotherapy if joints allow; break walks into shorter, cooler segments.</li>
            <li><strong>Senses:</strong> hearing and vision changes are common; add hand signals and night lights.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognition:</strong> watch for pacing at night, new anxiety, or house soiling; discuss diet, enrichment, and medication options.</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Grooming does not just keep the home cleaner; it prevents skin infections, spots tick bites early, and helps you catch lumps

            <li><strong>Brush the double coat:</strong> 2 to 3 times weekly with a slicker and an undercoat tool used correctly; follow with a metal comb.
              During seasonal coat blows, increase frequency so air reaches the skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> every 4 to 8 weeks or as needed, using gentle dog shampoo; rinse thoroughly and dry well to avoid hot spots.</li>
            <li><strong>Nails and paws:</strong> trim every 2 to 4 weeks; protect pads on hot pavement; check for interdigital irritation.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat management:</strong> exercise at dawn and dusk in hot months; offer shade, water, and AC rest; watch panting recovery time.</li>

        <section id="faq" className="mb-16">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What is the average lifespan of a German Shepherd?</strong><br />
            Most population studies place the median around 10.3 years. Many GSDs surpass this with lean weight, structured exercise,
            dental care, parasite prevention, and timely veterinary screening.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Which single change adds the most healthy months?</strong><br />
            Maintaining an ideal body condition. Lean-fed dogs live longer and stay more mobile. Combine portion control with a simple,
            repeatable exercise template.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Does early spay or neuter affect lifespan in GSDs?</strong><br />
            Early sterilization is associated with increased joint disorders in some GSD datasets. Work with your veterinarian on timing
            that considers orthopedic risk, behavior, and household needs.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Are German Shepherds at high risk for bloat?</strong><br />
            They are a deep-chested, large breed with some risk. Learn the signs of GDV and consider prophylactic gastropexy for at-risk
            individuals, especially if there is family history or if your vet recommends it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What about new longevity drugs?</strong><br />
            Research is active, including programs targeting metabolic pathways and studies of rapamycin. These remain under evaluation
            for safety and effectiveness. The proven levers today are weight, nutrition, exercise, dental care, and preventive medicine.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How do grooming and home setup affect lifespan?</strong><br />
            Clean skin, trimmed nails, traction on floors, and ramps reduce slips, infections, and stress. Grooming lets you find problems
            early and keeps activity comfortable.
          </p>
