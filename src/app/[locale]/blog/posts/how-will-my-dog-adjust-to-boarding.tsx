        <section id="what-adjustment-means">
          <h2>What “adjustment” really means</h2>
          <p>
            Boarding is a change in routine. Even friendly, well-socialized dogs notice when sleeping arrangements, feeding times, and daily rhythms shift. The role of a professional boarding facility is to make that transition predictable and gentle. Your role as the owner is to prepare a few key things in advance (we’ll cover those shortly) and choose a facility whose practices align with your dog’s needs and your comfort level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, you won’t be onsite to observe tiny moment-to-moment signals. It’s our ethical responsibility as operators to communicate how your dog is doing, to flag anything noteworthy, and to collaborate with you if we need to adjust the plan. You should never have to guess.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-we-support">
          <h2>How a good facility supports the adjustment</h2>
          <p className="italic">
            Below is exactly how we structure our day and environment. I’ll frame this in a way that’s useful for evaluating any facility—not just ours.
          </p>

          <h3>1) The right balance of play and quiet</h3>
          <p>
            We aim for a clean split between active play and true downtime. Play is where dogs stretch their legs and see friends; downtime is where the nervous system resets so excitement doesn’t snowball. During rest periods, our building is quiet—if you walk through, you won’t find a wall of barking. This isn’t just a preference; excessive noise can be aversive for dogs and people alike, and managing it is part of good care.
          </p>

          <h3>2) Thoughtful acoustics and kennel design</h3>
          <p>
            We use sound-absorbing materials and a layout that avoids echo-chambers. We keep dogs in rooms where they can see each other through kennels; that visual connection helps many dogs avoid the “I’m isolated” feeling while still being safe and contained. Rooms are modestly sized on purpose; limiting group size helps everyone relax.
          </p>

          <h3>3) Light cycles that support a shared rhythm</h3>
          <p>
            We run predictable light cycles (simulating sunrise/sunset) so the entire building is on the same schedule. Some jurisdictions specifically require natural light exposure; others allow artificial cycles. Either way, the principle is the same: consistent days and nights help dogs settle into a routine quickly.
          </p>

          <h3>4) Space that’s generous and practical</h3>
          <p>
            Our kennels are large with proper beds—no gimmicky “suites.” The goal isn’t isolation; it’s comfort with awareness of what’s happening around them. We’ll add a crate if an owner requests it because a familiar den can help certain dogs feel at home, but we don’t crate by default.
          </p>

          <h3>5) Group play and individual attention—never cookie-cutter</h3>
          <p>
            We run a combined program of group play and one-on-one time, guided by the dog’s temperament and energy level. No one is forced into a one-size-fits-all schedule. We conduct a temperament assessment before boarding to place dogs appropriately. If a dog is an escape risk, persistently aggressive, or barks relentlessly despite support, we won’t accept the booking—because a dog who can’t relax here won’t have a good stay.
          </p>

          <h3>6) Clear rules around food and goodies</h3>
          <p>
            Owners provide all food. It’s safer for GI comfort and avoids liability. If you’d like us to give Kongs or treats, include them in your bag with instructions. We don’t feed anything you didn’t supply.
          </p>

          <h3>7) Professional boundaries with cameras and privacy</h3>
          <p>
            We use security cameras internally, but they aren’t open to the public. That protects staff privacy, keeps attention on dogs (not livestream theatrics), and reduces unproductive scrutiny that can distract from care. If you want real-time reassurance, we’ll communicate—clearly and promptly.
          </p>

        <section id="what-you-can-do">
          <h2>What you can do before drop-off</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Book a trial/evaluation.</strong> A brief trial day lets us learn your dog’s style and match them to the right playmates and routine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confirm vaccinations and timing.</strong> Core vaccines are the foundation, and many places also require Bordetella/parainfluenza. In some countries (e.g., the U.K.), primary vaccine series must be completed at least two weeks prior to boarding; always check local rules and your facility’s policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bag meals from home.</strong> Sudden diet changes are a common trigger for GI upset, so bring your dog’s regular food with simple, written instructions (portion, frequency, add-ons).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pack familiar comforts.</strong> A labeled Kong, favorite blanket, or slow feeder (if you use one) can make a big difference.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Share what matters.</strong> Tell us about meds, allergies, routines, quirks, and what “doing well” looks like for your dog. The more context, the better we can tailor care.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Set communication preferences.</strong> Let us know how often you want updates and who to contact if plans need to change.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="day-by-day">
          <h2>A realistic day-by-day timeline</h2>
          <h3>Before boarding</h3>
          <p>
            Expect a normal home routine and a short trial visit if we haven’t met your dog. We’ll review vaccines, health status, and your instructions.
          </p>

          <h3>Drop-off day</h3>
          <p>
            We focus on a smooth handoff: sniff around, short play or enrichment, then a calm rest period. We introduce roommates and playgroups deliberately—not as a free-for-all. The goal is predictable, quiet, and kind.
          </p>

          <h3>First overnight</h3>
          <p>
            With our light schedule and quiet hours, most dogs sleep well the first night. Staff monitor and adjust water, bedding, and enrichment as needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Days 2–4</h3>
          <p>
            This is where routine takes hold. Dogs learn the cadence of play-rest-meals and we fine-tune groupings based on how each dog settles. You won’t be onsite to observe nuances, so we summarize what’s useful and reach out if we need your input.
          </p>

          <h3>Pickup day</h3>
          <p>
            Most dogs are delighted and a bit amped—normal and healthy. We’ll share how the stay went and anything to keep in mind the first 24–48 hours at home (extra water breaks, a quiet evening, and their normal food).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="health-safety">
          <h2>Health &amp; safety: vaccines, cleaning, weather</h2>

          <h3>Vaccination basics</h3>
          <p>
            Facilities typically require current core vaccinations (distemper, adenovirus, parvovirus; rabies per local law) and often Bordetella/parainfluenza. The exact list and timing vary by country and state/province, so we follow current veterinary guidelines and applicable regulations in our region.
          </p>

          <h3>Cleaning and disinfecting</h3>
          <p>
            We use veterinary-grade disinfectants and follow manufacturer contact times (the time a surface must stay wet) after visible cleaning. Protocols cover bowls, kennels, toys, and high-touch areas—plus isolation procedures if a dog becomes ill.
          </p>

          <h3>Weather checks</h3>
          <p>
            Outdoor time is great—within limits. Many pets today are primarily indoor dogs and more sensitive to heat and cold. We follow local rules on temperature and always err on the side of comfort and safety, supplementing with indoor enrichment when weather isn’t ideal.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="capacity-staffing">
          <h2>Capacity, space, and staffing</h2>
          <p>
            We operate within a defined capacity, with square-footage standards per dog and a healthy staff-to-dog ratio. More isn’t better; appropriate space and hands-on supervision are what keep dogs safe and relaxed.
          </p>
          <p>
            For context, some public guidelines overseas call a ratio around one staff member per 25 dogs a typical baseline and one per 15 dogs a higher standard. We aim for roughly 1:15–20 and rarely exceed it, because good supervision is non-negotiable.
          </p>

          <h2>Country-by-country notes (U.S., Canada, U.K./Ireland, Australia, New Zealand)</h2>

          <h3>United States</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Vaccines:</strong> Most facilities follow AAHA and similar veterinary guidance for core/non-core vaccines; rabies is governed by state and local law.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Space:</strong> Federal standards for research/commercial settings use a floor-space formula; many states/localities set their own boarding rules. Ask your facility how they meet local requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sanitation:</strong> Many shelters/kennels adopt shelter-medicine cleaning practices (clear “clean first, then disinfect” steps and labeled contact times).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Canada</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Framework:</strong> Provinces and municipalities license kennels and often reference the CVMA’s <em>Code of Practice for Canadian Kennel Operations</em>. Expect vaccination documentation and record-keeping.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>United Kingdom &amp; Ireland</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Licensing:</strong> England’s model licensing conditions for boarding kennels specify lighting hours, noise-management plans, monitoring, and vaccination timing (e.g., completing primary courses two weeks before boarding).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ratios &amp; exercise:</strong> Guidance also addresses supervision, walking limits per handler, and nighttime checks (CCTV or in-person) as a higher standard.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Australia &amp; New Zealand</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Codes of practice:</strong> States like Victoria and New South Wales publish boarding codes with minimum standards for housing, hygiene, and management. New Zealand’s national <em>Code of Welfare: Dogs</em> covers kennel construction, bedding, and comfort.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mt-4">
            Bottom line: wherever you live, ask for the facility’s current license (if required), vaccination policy, cleaning protocol, and staffing plan. A professional operator will have them ready to share.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="after-pickup">
          <h2>After pickup: what to expect at home</h2>
          <p>
            Expect enthusiasm and a nap. Keep meals familiar (your regular food), offer extra water breaks, and give your dog a quiet evening to decompress. If anything seems off or you have questions, reach out—we’d much rather talk early than late.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ethics">
          <h2>Ethics &amp; communication</h2>
          <p>
            You’re trusting us with family. We honor that by sticking to clear protocols, staying within capacity, and communicating honestly. You won’t see a live camera feed from our building, but you will get straight answers, timely updates, and documentation on request. If something isn’t the right fit—like a dog who truly can’t relax here—we’ll say so and help you find a better option.
