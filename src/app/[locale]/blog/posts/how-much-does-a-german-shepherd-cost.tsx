          <p className="mb-3">
            Reputable breeders of German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) invest heavily in health testing, early socialization, and careful placement.
            That diligence shows up in the price. Pet-home puppies from responsible programs commonly land between <strong>$1,500 and $4,500</strong>,
            with working-line/protection prospects or titled adults costing significantly more. Adoption offers exceptional value: fees are often
            a few hundred dollars and frequently include core vaccines, sterilization, and microchipping. Either route, reserve cash for the
            first year‚Äôs setup and vetting.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Checklist: What you‚Äôre paying for (breeder puppies)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Hip/elbow screening in parents, and breeder-disclosed orthopedic/neurologic history.</li>

          <p className="mt-3">
            <em>Money-saving note:</em> Breed-specific rescues regularly place GSDs and GSD mixes into great pet homes. If your lifestyle favors an
            adult dog with known temperament‚Äîand you‚Äôre flexible about color/ear set/coat‚Äîadoption can be a smart financial and ethical choice.

            A healthy 65‚Äì90 lb GSD typically consumes <strong>~1,200‚Äì2,000 kcal/day</strong> depending on age, lean mass, climate, and workload.
            Large-breed-appropriate nutrition (complete &amp; balanced per AAFCO) supports skeletal health and body-condition control. Expect roughly
            <strong> $70‚Äì$160/month</strong> for quality kibble; fresh/frozen options can run <strong>$150‚Äì$350+/month</strong> for this size range. Treats and chews

            Annual wellness for a large dog often totals <strong>$300‚Äì$800</strong> (exams, vaccines, fecal/heartworm tests, basic labs). Dental cleanings
            vary widely with calculus and extractions; budget <strong>$400‚Äì$1,000+</strong> annually or biannually if your dog accrues tartar quickly.
            <em>Parasite prevention</em> averages roughly <strong>$20‚Äì$50/month</strong> combined (heartworm + flea/tick) for large-breed dosage tiers.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Orthopedic issues (cruciate ligament tears, hip dysplasia) are the <em>expensive</em> outliers for GSD budgets. Surgical repairs like TPLO or hip
            replacement can run into the <strong>thousands per limb</strong>, and that‚Äôs before imaging, rehab, or complications. An emergency-only cushion of
            <strong> $1,500‚Äì$3,000</strong> is a sensible starting target; <em>$5,000+</em> is more realistic for major surgery access.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>How much does it cost to buy a German Shepherd?</strong><br />
            Reputable pet-home puppies are commonly $1,500‚Äì$4,500. Adoption is often $50‚Äì$400 and can include vaccines/spay/neuter/microchip.
            Expect higher purchase prices for titled or protection-trained dogs.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>What‚Äôs the biggest long-term cost?</strong><br />
            Food, veterinary care (including a few big-ticket years), and paid exercise/boarding. Insurance premiums add predictability but
            increase monthly spend.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Can diet and exercise really change lifetime costs?</strong><br />
            Absolutely. Keeping a lean body condition and meeting exercise needs reduce orthopedic strain, behavior fallout, and medication bills‚Äîoften
            the difference between ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù and ‚Äúrunaway‚Äù costs over 10‚Äì13 years.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Is insurance worth it for a GSD?</strong><br />
            Many owners say yes due to orthopedic risk. Run quotes with your ZIP/age and compare against what you could reliably self-insure. Enroll
            early and stick with one policy for best coverage continuity.
