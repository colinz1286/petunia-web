          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Hip dysplasia (HD)</strong> is a developmental joint disease where the ball-and-socket hip does not fit or move normally, leading to laxity, pain, and arthritis. <strong>Early action</strong> matters: keep your dog lean, build muscle with controlled exercise and rehab, optimize home surfaces, and work with your veterinarian on pain control. <strong>Surgery</strong> can be life-changing in the right cases (juvenile pubic symphysiodesis, triple/double pelvic osteotomy, femoral head ostectomy, or total hip replacement), but many dogs do well long-term with a <strong>systematic non-surgical plan</strong>.
          </p>

            <strong>Petunia tip:</strong> Turn this article into your dog&apos;s <em>hip-care SOP</em>: record body weight targets, weekly exercise minutes, floor-surface fixes, medication schedules, and recheck dates so every caregiver follows the same plan.

        {/* WHAT IS HD */}
        <section id="what-is-hd" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What Hip Dysplasia Is (and Isn&apos;t)</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Hip dysplasia is a <strong>developmental</strong> joint disorder. Puppies are typically born with normal hips; as they grow, a combination of <strong>genetics</strong> and <strong>environmental influences</strong> (growth rate, body weight, activity, hormones) can produce a hip where the femoral head does not seat deeply or tightly in the acetabulum. The result is <strong>laxity</strong> (looseness) and abnormal motion that damages cartilage, inflames joint tissues, and accelerates <strong>osteoarthritis (OA)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Owners often imagine HD as a single yes/no event, but it is a <strong>continuum</strong>. Dogs can have mild laxity with few signs or severe dysplasia with early pain and gait changes. Importantly, HD is not the same as <em>hip luxation</em> from trauma, nor is it identical to cruciate ligament disease in the knee, although these conditions can coexist.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">
            A helpful mental model: <strong>fit + force + time</strong>. Poor hip fit increases damaging forces with every step; across months and years, those forces reshape the joint. Your plan reduces damaging forces (weight, slippery floors), improves support (muscle), and controls inflammation and pain (meds, supplements, procedures).

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> heritable predisposition; risk varies by breed and line.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid growth &amp; excess calories:</strong> overfeeding in puppyhood increases risk and severity.</li>
            <li><strong>Excess body weight:</strong> higher lifelong joint load; strong link with arthritis progression.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomechanics &amp; surfaces:</strong> repeated slips on tile/wood; high-impact jump/stop activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Early neuter timing:</strong> research is evolving; in some breeds, early neuter may influence orthopedic risk.</li>

        <section id="diagnostics" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Diagnostics &amp; Imaging</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Your veterinarian will combine <strong>history, orthopedic exam, and imaging</strong>. Standard radiographs taken under correct positioning remain the primary tool for diagnosis and OA grading. Two specialized approaches assess laxity more objectively:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>OFA-style views:</strong> evaluate conformation and secondary arthritis changes; typically at or after skeletal maturity.</li>
            <li><strong>PennHIP:</strong> quantifies passive hip laxity (distraction index) and can be performed as early as 16 weeks by trained providers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-0">
            Imaging also rules out differentials such as cruciate disease, lumbosacral issues, or trauma. Pain scoring and gait analysis (including force-plate where available) help track response to therapy over time.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Underwater treadmill or swim sets:</strong> buoyancy reduces joint load while building muscle.</li>

        <section id="surgery" className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Surgical Options: When &amp; Why</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Surgery is considered when pain persists despite optimized conservative care, or when imaging and age suggest a procedure that can change the joint&apos;s trajectory. Your primary vet will often refer to a <strong>board-certified surgeon (ACVS)</strong>. Common procedures include:
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Juvenile Pubic Symphysiodesis (JPS)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            A minimally invasive procedure performed at a <strong>very young age</strong> (typically 12‚Äì20 weeks) to alter pelvic growth and improve coverage of the femoral head. Requires early diagnosis and appropriate candidacy.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Triple/Double Pelvic Osteotomy (TPO/DPO)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            For <strong>young dogs</strong> with lax hips but minimal OA, the pelvis is cut and rotated to increase coverage. Post-op rehab is essential; outcomes can be excellent in selected cases.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Femoral Head &amp; Neck Ostectomy (FHO)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Removes the femoral head to eliminate bone-on-bone pain, creating a pseudo-joint supported by soft tissue and muscle. More commonly used in <strong>small to medium dogs</strong> or as a salvage option; diligent rehab is key to function.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Total Hip Replacement (THR)</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Replaces the damaged joint with prosthetic components, often delivering near-normal function and pain relief in <strong>appropriately selected patients</strong>. Requires specialist care, strict post-op management, and budgeting for potential complications.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">
            Which option is best depends on age, severity, OA changes, other orthopedic disease, and your goals. A thorough surgeon consult will weigh risks, benefits, costs, and aftercare realities for your household.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Costs vary by geography and case complexity. Families typically budget for imaging, medications, rehab blocks, and potential surgery. Very broad U.S. estimates (subject to change) often include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Initial workup (exam, radiographs, labs): commonly hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>Rehab packages: variable; plan recurring sessions plus at-home work.</li>
            <li>JPS/TPO/DPO/FHO/THR: ranges from lower four figures to well into five figures depending on procedure and region.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Recovery ranges from several weeks of restricted activity (osteotomies, THR) to earlier functional improvement with FHO (when rehab is rigorous). Expect leash-only bathroom breaks early, crate or pen rest, progressive rehab milestones, and recheck imaging when indicated.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Can a dog with hip dysplasia live a normal life?</strong><br />
            Many do. The combination of lean body weight, smart activity design, household traction, pain control, and rehab can preserve excellent quality of life. Surgery is reserved for cases where conservative care no longer controls pain or function.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Is swimming always good for hip dysplasia?</strong><br />
            Often, yes‚Äîbuoyancy reduces load while building muscle. Some dogs are anxious or over-aroused in water; underwater treadmill offers more control. Dry thoroughly and monitor ears and skin after wet sessions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Which supplement actually helps?</strong><br />
            Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) have the most consistent evidence for OA comfort. Other supplements may help individual dogs but have mixed study results. Discuss brand quality and dosing with your veterinarian.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Will weight loss really make a difference?</strong><br />
            Yes‚Äîjoint load is highly sensitive to body mass. Even modest weight reduction can yield large improvements in comfort and mobility.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-0">
            <strong>How do I know it&apos;s time to consider surgery?</strong><br />
            Patterns to watch: persistent pain despite optimized meds and rehab, major activity restrictions that harm quality of life, or imaging that suggests a procedure could materially improve hip mechanics. A surgical consult can outline realistic outcomes for your dog.
