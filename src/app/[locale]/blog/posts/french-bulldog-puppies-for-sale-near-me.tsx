          <p className="mb-4">
            When you search ‚ÄúFrench bulldog puppies for sale near me,‚Äù prioritize health transparency and humane practices over convenience. For rescues, look for clear medical and behavior notes plus a return safety net. For breeders, ask for parent health testing (respiratory function grading, eyes, hips, elbows, patellas, and cardiac as appropriate), meet the dam, and review a written contract with lifetime take-back. Frenchies are beloved companions, but they are also a brachycephalic breed; thoughtful selection, weight control, and climate-aware routines protect their comfort for the next decade.

          <p className="mb-3">
            French bulldogs are a brachycephalic breed, which means their short muzzle can predispose them to breathing challenges. Ethical selection minimizes risk. You are not seeking ‚Äúperfect‚Äù‚Äîyou are stacking the odds in favor of comfort by asking for relevant screening and planning your home to support calm routines and healthy body weight.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Key screenings to ask about</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Respiratory function grading (BOAS):</strong> A structured assessment that evaluates breathing at rest and after light exercise helps identify dogs affected by brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome.</li>
            <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Exam by a veterinary ophthalmologist; Frenchies can be prone to corneal and eyelid issues‚Äîscreening supports early detection and ethical breeding.</li>
            <li><strong>Patellas &amp; cardiac:</strong> Basic orthopedic and cardiac screening (auscultation; echocardiogram if indicated) are commonly recorded by responsible breeders.</li>
            <li><strong>Hips/elbows:</strong> Some breeders also screen hips/elbows and disclose methods used. Ask how they interpret results and why they test.</li>
            <li><strong>Weight &amp; conditioning plan:</strong> Regardless of source, commit to lean body condition‚Äîextra weight worsens breathing and joint stress.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Everyday care considerations for brachycephalic dogs</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Avoid heat/humidity spikes; schedule play for mornings/evenings and use shade and water generously.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Short, structured sessions with rest blocks; prioritize sniff walks and puzzles over frantic sprints.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling &amp; grooming:</strong> Gentle wrinkle care and drying after baths; watch for skin fold irritation.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical planning:</strong> Discuss anesthesia and sedation plans with your veterinarian well in advance of any procedure.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="rounded-md border border-[#d9cfc2] bg-[#f6efe4] p-4 text-sm">

          <p className="mb-3">
            A great Frenchie is people-oriented, affectionate, and able to settle. No single test predicts a lifetime, but simple observations reveal useful tendencies. Keep sessions short and kind; avoid over-arousal. If you can, bring a trainer or behavior professional for a second set of eyes.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">A gentle framework you can use</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3">
            <li><strong>Social approach:</strong> Does the puppy volunteer soft contact and re-engage after brief pauses?</li>
            <li><strong>Startle/recovery:</strong> A neutral novel sound should prompt orienting and quick recovery with support.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling tolerance:</strong> Brief touches of ears, paws, and tail; relaxed acceptance is ideal. Keep it light.</li>
            <li><strong>Toy/food engagement:</strong> Enjoys a toy but can disengage; trades a chew for a treat without tension.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy regulation:</strong> After short play, can the puppy settle on a mat with you?</li>

          </ul>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Responsible breeders track these observations to help match puppies to homes. Rescues rely on foster notes across many days, which is equally valuable because it reflects real-home rhythms and climate management.

            <strong>What is respiratory function grading and why does it matter?</strong><br />
            It is a structured clinical assessment for brachycephalic dogs that evaluates breathing at rest and after light exercise. Results help owners and breeders understand risk and make care or breeding decisions.

            <strong>Do Frenchies need eye exams?</strong><br />
            Eye screening by a veterinary ophthalmologist can detect issues early and informs ethical breeding. Ask to see certificates and current results.

            <strong>Are Frenchies safe under anesthesia?</strong><br />
            Many undergo procedures safely with appropriate protocols, but brachycephalic breeds have higher risks around anesthesia/sedation. Discuss airway and recovery plans with your veterinarian well in advance of any procedure.

            <strong>Can a Frenchie be an active family dog?</strong><br />
            Yes‚Äîwithin climate-aware limits. Short, structured play with generous rest keeps breathing comfortable. Avoid heat spikes and high-arousal marathons.

            <strong>Does Petunia replace veterinary care?</strong><br />
