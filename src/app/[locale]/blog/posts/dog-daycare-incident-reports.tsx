            <li><strong>Antecedents</strong> (what set the stage): arrival surge, toy resource, doorway crowding, intact dog dynamics, weather stress, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral behavior descriptions</strong> (‚ÄúDog A mounted Dog B; Dog B stiffened and turned; brief snap; handlers body-blocked and split‚Äù) instead of labels like ‚Äúdominant‚Äù or ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù</li>
            <li><strong>Interventions</strong> (interrupt cues, body blocks, splits, crating, room change) and <strong>separation/treatment</strong> (cooldown area, first-aid steps, observed vitals/behavior afterward).</li>

Read your waiver and ask for written confirmation of what they‚Äôll cover. If you have pet insurance, save itemized invoices and medical notes and file a claim‚Äîreimbursements typically apply after your deductible and co-insurance, subject to limits and waiting periods.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>1) The report says ‚Äúno visible injuries,‚Äù but my dog is sore‚Äîwhat now?</strong><br />
            Punctures and deeper bruising can hide under fur. Do a full body check and call your veterinarian; seek in-person care if soreness worsens or you find wounds.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>2) Should I request video?</strong><br />
            Yes, politely. Video clarifies antecedents and timing and helps a trainer or vet craft a prevention plan.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>3) Who pays for the vet visit?</strong><br />
            It depends on your contract and facility policy. Ask what they typically cover and get confirmation in writing; pet insurance may reimburse you, subject to your policy.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>4) Is a single scuffle a reason to quit daycare?</strong><br />
            Not always. Many dogs return successfully after cooldown and better structure. If your dog remains stressed or requires constant interruption, consider alternatives.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>5) What if the other dog‚Äôs owner blames mine?</strong><br />
            Keep communications through the facility. Ask the manager for a clear, neutral timeline and a prevention plan that addresses both dogs‚Äô needs.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>6) My dog hates the vet‚Äîshould I still go?</strong><br />
            Yes if there are punctures, lacerations, swelling, pain, or behavior changes. Clinics can use low-stress handling and pain control as needed.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>7) Do I need antibiotics for every bite?</strong><br />
            Treatment is case-specific. Your veterinarian will evaluate location, depth, contamination, and your dog‚Äôs health to determine the plan.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>8) Can I bandage at home?</strong><br />
            You can apply gentle pressure dressings for bleeding and cover wounds to protect during transport, but bandaging is not definitive care. Follow veterinary instructions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>9) The facility discouraged a vet visit‚Äîis that normal?</strong><br />
            No. Professional facilities support prompt evaluation when warranted and provide documentation for the clinic.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>10) Will pet insurance raise my premium after a claim?</strong><br />
            Policies vary. Read your policy or ask your insurer; generally, reimbursements are subject to deductible, co-insurance, and limits.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>11) What should be in the follow-up plan?</strong><br />
            Cooldown period, re-intro conditions, room/pod and ratio changes, staff assignments, enrichment plan, and a review date.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>12) How long should cooldown last?</strong><br />
            Typically several days to a couple of weeks, depending on medical healing and your dog‚Äôs stress level.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>13) Should my dog wear a muzzle for re-intros?</strong><br />
            Basket muzzles can add a safety margin when trained positively. Use with professional guidance; muzzles don‚Äôt replace environment changes or handling skill.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>14) What if I don‚Äôt trust the report?</strong><br />
            Ask for a manager review, video, and logs; request a second staff statement if available. If trust can‚Äôt be restored, consider moving providers and, if appropriate, contacting your local licensing authority.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>15) Is it normal to sign a waiver?</strong><br />
            Yes‚Äîmost facilities use waivers that outline risks and dispute processes. Read before signing and keep a copy. See our <Link href={`/${locale}/blog/dog-boarding-waiver-what-to-look-for`} className="underline">waiver guide</Link>.
