          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            Boxers are genetically predisposed to skin issues, including environmental allergies,
            food sensitivities, and a higher risk of lumps or tumors. Owners should monitor their
            dog’s skin for itching, redness, swelling, or growths. Early veterinary exams, allergy
            management, and a healthy diet are essential for prevention and care.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="overview" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Boxers Are Prone to Skin Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The Boxer’s short, smooth coat offers little protection against allergens or
            environmental irritants. Their genetics also predispose them to certain cancers
            and tumors that manifest as skin growths. Combined with sensitive immune systems,
            Boxers often experience dermatological issues throughout their lives.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="allergies" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Allergies in Boxers</h2>
          <p>
            Allergies are one of the most common skin problems in Boxers. They may present as
            itching, licking, ear infections, or inflamed skin. Triggers include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Pollen, mold, dust mites, grass</li>
            <li><strong>Food-related:</strong> Proteins like beef, chicken, or grains</li>
            <li><strong>Contact allergies:</strong> Certain shampoos, detergents, or fabrics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Chronic itching and ear infections are common allergy symptoms. Veterinary allergy
            testing may help identify triggers, while treatment often includes antihistamines,
            special diets, or medicated shampoos.
          </p>

        <section id="lumps" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Lumps, Tumors, and Growths</h2>
          <p>
            Boxers are among the breeds most at risk for developing skin tumors, including
            mast cell tumors. These lumps may look harmless at first but can be malignant.
            Any new growth should be checked by a veterinarian immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common skin growths in Boxers include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Mast cell tumors:</strong> Potentially aggressive; require biopsy and treatment</li>
            <li><strong>Benign fatty lumps (lipomas):</strong> Common in older dogs</li>
            <li><strong>Warts or papillomas:</strong> Viral-based, often harmless</li>
            <li><strong>Abscesses:</strong> Result of infection or trauma</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Regular veterinary checkups and early removal of suspicious lumps increase the chances
            of successful treatment.
          </p>

        <section id="early-signs" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Early Warning Signs to Watch For</h2>
          <p>
            Owners should regularly examine their Boxer’s skin for:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Excessive scratching or licking</li>
            <li>Redness, bumps, or swelling</li>
            <li>Scabs or hot spots</li>
            <li>Unusual lumps or changes in size/shape of existing ones</li>
            <li>Hair loss or thinning coat</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Catching these signs early allows veterinarians to treat conditions before they
            escalate into more serious problems.

        <section id="prevention" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Prevention and Skin Care Tips</h2>
          <p>
            Preventive care is key for Boxers prone to skin problems:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Brush weekly to remove dead hair and improve circulation</li>
            <li>Use hypoallergenic shampoos and avoid harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>Provide flea and tick prevention year-round</li>
            <li>Maintain a clean living environment to minimize allergens</li>
            <li>Schedule annual (or semi-annual) vet checkups</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Preventive routines reduce flare-ups and help Boxers maintain healthy skin.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="treatment" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Treatment Options and Veterinary Support</h2>
          <p>
            Treatment depends on the underlying condition:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Medications, hypoallergenic diets, or immunotherapy</li>
            <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Antibiotics or antifungal medications</li>
            <li><strong>Mast cell tumors:</strong> Surgical removal, chemotherapy, or radiation</li>
            <li><strong>Chronic dermatitis:</strong> Medicated shampoos and topical ointments</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Veterinarians may also recommend referral to a veterinary dermatologist for persistent or complicated cases.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="diet" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Diet and Supplements for Skin Health</h2>
          <p>
            Nutrition plays a big role in managing Boxer skin health. Omega-3 fatty acids
            from fish oil reduce inflammation, while vitamin E supports skin repair.
            Some Boxers improve significantly on limited-ingredient or grain-free diets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Owners should consult their veterinarian before making dietary changes,
            particularly if their Boxer has other health conditions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="boarding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boarding and Daycare Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Boxers thrive in social environments but require attentive care in boarding
            and daycare settings. Staff should be informed of any allergy medications
            or skin sensitivities. Facilities that offer climate-controlled play areas
            and hypoallergenic cleaning supplies are best suited for Boxers with skin concerns.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Boxers are loyal, playful companions but need vigilant skin care. From allergies
            to tumors, their predisposition to skin problems means owners must stay proactive.
            By recognizing early warning signs, maintaining preventive routines, and seeking
            veterinary care promptly, Boxers can live long, healthy lives despite these risks.
