                                The creators of Petunia are also owners of a boarding and daycare facility ‚Äî that‚Äôs how we got our start in this industry back in 2017. We know the daily challenges firsthand, because we‚Äôve lived them.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-lg text-balance">
                                People who stay in this industry only stay for one reason: they love the animals. They sacrifice weekends, sleep, and margins of comfort to make life better for the dogs in their care. Your software should never punish that. You shouldn‚Äôt have to watch hard-earned money leak out of your pocket just to manage the basics. We don‚Äôt make you pay for our rent ‚Äî we simply have our priorities straight. We wanted to build a software company that actually cared about the customer‚Ä¶ and their wallets (important to not forget that last part!).
                                <br /><br />
                                Caring doesn‚Äôt mean overcharging; it means delivering the features that make your life easier, at a price that respects the work you do and the sacrifices you make. While families go away, they trust you to take care of their dog while they‚Äôre on vacation. That doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt be able to afford a nice vacation as well!
                                <br /><br />
                                An incredibly small in-home boarding and daycare facility should not have to sacrifice features simply because they can‚Äôt afford them. And a large facility should not have to give up the fine-tuned features that smaller software packages offer. Right now, everyone on both sides of the fence is forced to compromise. We‚Äôre going to eliminate that.
                                <br /><br />
                                Today, Petunia already packs more features than most of the competition. Within the next 6‚Äì12 months, we will have enough features to exceed our competition. And as other companies continue to raise prices, we will be aiming to lower ours. Yes, that‚Äôs not a typo. The only question left that you have to ask yourself is: which company do you want to work with long-term?
                            </p>
