          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Golden Retrievers are one of the world’s most beloved breeds — but also one of
            the most studied for cancer. For decades, veterinarians and geneticists have
            sought to understand why these dogs face higher cancer rates than many other
            breeds. The goal is not fear, but awareness: by understanding risk, owners can
            detect problems earlier and extend both lifespan and healthspan.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Current Cancer Rates in Golden Retrievers</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Morris Animal Foundation’s Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS)</strong>,
            now in its second decade, continues to offer the most detailed picture of cancer
            in the breed. Preliminary data released in 2024 show that roughly
            <strong> 60 percent of Golden Retrievers will develop cancer</strong> in their
            lifetime — a rate nearly twice that of the average dog population
            (Morris Animal Foundation, 2024).  
          </p>
          <p>
            This figure includes both malignant and benign tumors, with the majority of
            cancer-related deaths attributed to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma.
            Comparative studies from the University of California Davis and the
            Royal Veterinary College corroborate these trends, noting that the incidence
            remains high even in well-bred lines that follow recommended screening
            protocols.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="types" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Most Common Cancer Types</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              <strong>Hemangiosarcoma:</strong> A fast-moving vascular cancer affecting the
              spleen, heart, or skin. Often silent until rupture occurs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lymphoma:</strong> A cancer of white blood cells; may cause swollen
              lymph nodes, lethargy, or weight loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mast Cell Tumor:</strong> A common skin cancer in Goldens; prognosis
              varies widely depending on grade.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Osteosarcoma:</strong> Bone cancer more typical in large breeds;
              presents as lameness or swelling in limbs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA, 2024), early
            recognition and histopathology remain the gold standards for determining tumor
            type and guiding treatment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="riskfactors" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Known Risk Factors</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history is the most consistent predictor of
              cancer risk. The GRLS is mapping specific genetic variants associated with
              hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma susceptibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sex and reproductive status:</strong> Some studies suggest differences
              in cancer patterns between intact and sterilized dogs; timing of spay/neuter
              can influence certain tumor types (Hart et al., 2020).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Body condition:</strong> Overweight dogs experience higher systemic
              inflammation, which may influence tumor growth and immune response.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Exposure to lawn chemicals,
              secondhand smoke, and some household toxins may elevate risk, though data
              remain mixed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No single factor guarantees disease; rather, cancer in Goldens reflects the
            interaction of genetics, lifestyle, and chance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="early-detection" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Early Detection and Screening</h2>
          <p>
            Regular veterinary exams remain the strongest defense. The GRCA Health and Research Committee (2025)
            recommends twice-yearly physicals for dogs over age 8, including palpation for
            lumps, abdominal checks, and cardiovascular assessments. Annual or semi-annual
            bloodwork can reveal subtle organ changes before outward symptoms appear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emerging liquid-biopsy tests that detect cancer DNA in blood are promising, but
            the AVMA cautions they should complement — not replace — diagnostics like
            imaging or biopsy. Early veterinary evaluation of unexplained weakness, pale
            gums, rapid belly swelling, or persistent lameness remains critical.
          </p>

        <section id="prevention" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Reducing Risk Through Lifestyle and Care</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-3">
            <li>
              Maintain a <strong>lean body condition score (4/9 to 5/9)</strong>; longevity
              studies (Kealy et al., JAVMA 2002) show lean dogs live longer with delayed
              chronic disease onset.
            </li>
            <li>
              Feed a balanced AAFCO-compliant diet and limit high-fat treats. Consider omega-3
              supplementation under veterinary guidance for anti-inflammatory benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid tobacco smoke exposure and limit pesticide contact on lawns or carpets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Schedule annual wellness labs and imaging as your dog ages; early intervention
              improves outcomes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While no owner can eliminate risk entirely, these habits can meaningfully shift the curve toward a longer, healthier life.
