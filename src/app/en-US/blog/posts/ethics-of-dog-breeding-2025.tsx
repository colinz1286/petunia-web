          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In 2025, ethical dog breeding stands at a crossroads. Technological advances,
            social pressure, and new welfare standards have forced breeders to rethink
            what “responsibility” truly means. For many, the goal is no longer just to
            produce puppies — it’s to protect bloodlines, maintain health, and ensure
            that each dog’s life has genuine purpose and dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethical breeding requires balancing three forces: profit, purpose, and preservation.
            When handled thoughtfully, these forces reinforce one another. When ignored,
            they can compromise welfare and public trust.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Role of Profit in Responsible Breeding</h2>
          <p>
            Profit itself isn’t unethical — it’s unsustainable losses that often lead to
            corner-cutting. Responsible breeders recognize that fair pricing allows
            investment in quality nutrition, prenatal care, and comprehensive
            health testing. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA, 2024)
            emphasizes that ethical breeding programs must be financially viable to
            support lifetime care for both breeding dogs and unsold puppies.

          <p>
            Problems arise when revenue becomes the sole metric of success.
            Overproduction, inadequate socialization, and poor transparency follow.
            Sustainable breeding means aligning financial stability with moral
            accountability.

        <section id="purpose" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Purpose: Preserving Function and Temperament</h2>
          <p>
            Every breed was created for a reason — herding, retrieving, companionship,
            or protection. In modern times, these functions have shifted, but purpose
            remains essential for behavioral health. The American Kennel Club (AKC, 2025)
            notes that maintaining temperament and structure is as important as
            appearance; dogs bred without purpose often suffer from anxiety or
            incompatibility with family life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethical breeders select pairings that honor the breed’s original intent
            while meeting today’s lifestyles. Purpose-driven breeding strengthens the
            emotional well-being of both dogs and owners.
          </p>

        <section id="preservation" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Preservation Breeding and Genetic Diversity</h2>
          <p>
            Preservation breeding protects genetic integrity without falling into
            inbreeding traps. According to the Institute of Canine Biology (2024),
            maintaining an effective population size above 100 breeding animals is
            crucial for long-term genetic health. Ethical programs track pedigrees
            across generations, using DNA panels to avoid excessive COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding)
            while preserving essential traits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technology now enables breeders to model diversity before pairings occur.
            Used wisely, these tools prevent the bottlenecks that once plagued
            purebred populations.
          </p>

        <section id="modern-challenges" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Modern Challenges and Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
          <p>
            Social media has amplified both education and criticism. In 2025, breeders
            face public expectations for full transparency — from housing conditions to
            financial ethics. The Royal Veterinary College (2025) reports that 68 percent
            of new puppy buyers now request proof of health testing before purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is progress. Yet the pressure to commercialize “rare” or “micro” variants
            continues to erode welfare. Breeders must resist marketing trends that
            prioritize novelty over well-being. Collaboration with veterinarians,
            geneticists, and breed clubs remains the ethical compass.

        <section id="conclusion" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The ethics of breeding in 2025 require humility and balance.
            Profit funds quality; purpose guides intent; preservation safeguards the future.
            Together, these pillars define responsible stewardship of our canine companions.
            By treating dogs as partners in care rather than products, we can build an
            industry rooted in respect, transparency, and long-term welfare.
