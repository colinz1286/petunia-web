          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Short Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Small and some medium-sized breeds often live the longest due to slower growth, lower metabolic strain, and reduced risk of
            breed-specific diseases. Genetics play a strong role, but lifestyle factors such as weight management, mobility preservation,
            and stable environments significantly influence lifespan. Long-lived breeds reveal clear lessons: slower ageing comes from
            metabolic efficiency, lean body condition, and reduced inflammatory burden.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Section 1 — Breed Analysis */}
        <section id="overview" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Analysis of Small, Medium, and Long-Lived Breeds</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Many of the longest-living dog breeds fall into the small or medium-size categories. These dogs tend to have slower growth
            rates, lower metabolic demands, and fewer degenerative joint issues compared to larger breeds.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Small breeds</strong> such as Chihuahuas, Toy Poodles, Dachshunds, and Shih Tzus often reach 14–18 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium breeds</strong> such as Border Terriers, Shelties, and Beagles average 13–15 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-lived outliers</strong> include the Rat Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, and Australian Cattle Dog.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            In contrast, giant breeds—Great Danes, Saint Bernards, Mastiffs—move through growth phases quickly and experience higher
            metabolic strain, leading to significantly shorter lifespans.

        <section id="genetics" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Genetic Factors That Influence Slower Ageing</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Genetics play a major role in determining ageing rate. Long-lived breeds tend to have fewer hereditary conditions, more
            stable cardiovascular systems, and metabolic pathways that produce lower baseline inflammation.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li>Reduced incidence of heart disease in several toy and terrier breeds.</li>
            <li>Lower cancer rates compared to large retrievers and shepherds.</li>
            <li>Genetically efficient energy utilization supporting healthier ageing.</li>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Real-world longevity data show consistent lifestyle patterns among dogs that live into their late teens. These habits reduce
            inflammation, protect cognition, and maintain mobility across ageing.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li>Maintaining a lean body condition throughout life.</li>
            <li>Daily exercise focused on mobility and strength rather than intensity.</li>
            <li>Lower-stress environments with predictable routines.</li>
            <li>High-quality diets emphasizing anti-inflammatory ingredients.</li>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Faster growth and higher metabolic rates correlate with shorter lifespans across mammalian species. Large and giant breeds
            grow rapidly, experience accelerated cellular turnover, and face elevated orthopedic and cardiovascular risk.
          </p>

            The patterns seen in long-lived breeds offer actionable insights for dogs of every size. Longevity is influenced by daily
            choices that support metabolic efficiency, emotional stability, and joint health.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li>Keep dogs lean from puppyhood through old age.</li>
            <li>Provide consistent low-to-moderate activity rather than occasional intense exercise.</li>
            <li>Reduce chronic inflammation through diet and dental care.</li>
            <li>Support joint health early with movement and weight control.</li>
            <li>Create predictable routines to reduce stress burden.</li>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Small and medium-sized breeds offer valuable clues about how dogs can age more slowly and live longer. While genetics shape
            predispositions, lifestyle choices determine how those genetics are expressed. By applying the lessons revealed by
            long-lived breeds—lean body condition, metabolic stability, mobility preservation, and daily routines—owners can give any
            dog a meaningful longevity advantage.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How to judge a longevity claim like a clinician, not a marketer</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Longevity content gets stronger when it separates mechanism, plausibility, and real-world outcome data. A promising pathway, biomarker shift, or mouse result is not the same thing as meaningful healthspan improvement in pet dogs living normal lives. Before taking any claim seriously, ask what population was studied, what endpoint actually improved, how long the effect lasted, and what tradeoffs appeared alongside it.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Best-case evidence:</strong> controlled canine data tied to function, quality of life, or delayed disease, not just theory.</li>
            <li><strong>Useful supporting evidence:</strong> consistent veterinary reasoning, safety monitoring, and transparent limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak evidence:</strong> one mechanism-heavy narrative without dosing clarity, patient selection, or follow-up outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Essential question:</strong> what would success look like for a real dog over months or years, not just in a headline?</li>
