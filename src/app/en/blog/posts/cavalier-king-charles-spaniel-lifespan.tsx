          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            The typical Cavalier King Charles Spaniel lives <strong>9&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;years</strong>, 
            though many reach their teens with proactive care. Genetics, heart health, diet, and 
            weight management are major factors. Regular checkups, dental hygiene, and balanced 
            nutrition can significantly extend both lifespan and quality of life.
          </p>

        <section id="average-lifespan" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Average Lifespan of Cavaliers</h2>
          <p>
            Cavalier King Charles Spaniels typically live between nine and twelve years. 
            This range is slightly shorter than the average small-breed lifespan, largely due to 
            inherited heart disease risks. Some Cavaliers, however, exceed 14&nbsp;years when 
            provided with excellent veterinary care and a heart-healthy lifestyle.

        <section id="factors" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Factors That Affect Longevity</h2>
          <p>
            A Cavalier&rsquo;s lifespan depends on a mix of genetics, daily habits, and early detection of 
            disease. The biggest influences include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Genetic background and responsible breeding</li>
            <li>Diet quality and maintaining a healthy body condition</li>
            <li>Heart health and early detection of mitral valve disease</li>
            <li>Routine exercise and mental engagement</li>
            <li>Access to preventive veterinary care and dental cleanings</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="nutrition" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Nutrition and Weight Management</h2>
          <p>
            Obesity can shorten a Cavalier&rsquo;s life by as much as two years. Owners should aim for 
            visible waist definition and easy-to-feel ribs. Feed a balanced diet formulated for small 
            breeds with moderate fat and controlled sodium to support heart function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fresh vegetables such as carrots or green beans make excellent low-calorie treats. 
            Avoid table scraps, excessive sodium, and high-fat foods that increase cardiac strain.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="exercise" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Exercise and Lifestyle</h2>
          <p>
            Cavaliers thrive on moderate daily activity. Two brisk 20-minute walks per day or 
            gentle indoor play help maintain muscle tone without overexerting the heart. 
            Avoid strenuous activity in hot weather and always watch for signs of fatigue or coughing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental stimulation—such as puzzle feeders or obedience training—also supports brain 
            health and reduces anxiety, contributing to overall longevity.

        <section id="veterinary-care" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Veterinary Care and Screenings</h2>
          <p>
            Annual wellness exams are critical. After age five, Cavaliers should receive routine 
            heart auscultations and echocardiograms to detect <strong>mitral valve disease (MVD)</strong> 
            early. Timely use of medication can delay progression for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eye and dental checkups are equally important; gum disease and ocular infections can 
            exacerbate systemic inflammation and affect heart health.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="breeding" className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Importance of Responsible Breeding</h2>
          <p>
            Reputable breeders who screen for cardiac and eye conditions have dramatically reduced 
            early-onset disease in their lines. Prospective owners should request proof of 
            <strong>OFA</strong> or <strong>EKG</strong> certifications for parent dogs and avoid 
            backyard breeders who cannot provide them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supporting ethical breeding helps improve the overall health and life expectancy of 
            future generations of Cavaliers.

          <p>
            While genetics play a major role in a Cavalier&rsquo;s lifespan, proactive care can make 
            a measurable difference. Balanced nutrition, weight control, regular exercise, and 
            diligent veterinary screening are key. With mindful management and compassion, owners 
            can extend both the quantity and quality of their dog&rsquo;s life.
