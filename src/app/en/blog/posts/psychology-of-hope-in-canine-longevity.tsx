          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Short Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Owners seek longevity solutions because losing a dog is emotionally devastating. This creates vulnerability to marketing
            that promises more time. Anti-ageing medicine can improve healthspan, but expectations must remain grounded in evidence.
            Ethical choices require balancing hope with realism, prioritizing comfort over lifespan alone, and recognizing red flags in
            emotional or predatory sales practices. Humane longevity means extending joy, not extending suffering.

            Emotional Drivers: Grief Avoidance, Fear of Loss, and Attachment Psychology
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Dogs occupy roles comparable to family members, emotional anchors, and sources of daily companionship. Because of this,
            the anticipation of loss triggers powerful psychological responses.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Grief avoidance</strong>: owners seek anything that delays inevitable loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of regret</strong>: concern about not having done “enough.”</li>
            <li><strong>Attachment psychology</strong>: the human-animal bond intensifies desire for control.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity and stability</strong>: many owners center routines around their dogs.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            These emotional drivers make owners more receptive to claims of extended lifespan—even when evidence is limited.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Owners Overestimate Potential Lifespan Gains</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Studies on cognitive bias show that when humans hope for an emotionally meaningful outcome, they dramatically
            overinterpret ambiguous evidence. Longevity science is especially prone to this effect.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Headline distortion</strong>: media summarizes complex science as breakthroughs.</li>
            <li><strong>Halo effect</strong>: promising biomarkers are mistaken for proven outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Selective attention</strong>: owners remember optimistic claims, not limitations.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional anchoring</strong>: hope outweighs statistical reasoning.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Owners often assume “healthspan improvement” equals “lifespan extension,” even though no drug has demonstrated this yet.

            Ethical Sales Practices vs Emotional Marketing Risks
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The anti-ageing pet market is expected to grow rapidly. Ethical companies communicate clearly about limitations, whereas
            predatory brands exploit hope and grief.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Ethical companies</strong> emphasize uncertainty and publish methods when possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Predatory companies</strong> use emotional language such as “reverse ageing” or “restore youth.”</li>
            <li><strong>High-pressure sales</strong> exploit fear of missing out.</li>

            Owners should approach longevity claims with the same skepticism used in human healthcare. Responsible evaluation requires
            looking beyond marketing material.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li>Ask whether the data is peer-reviewed.</li>
            <li>Look for sample sizes, control groups, and measured biomarkers.</li>
            <li>Consult veterinarians—not advertisements—before acting.</li>

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Longevity interventions should always prioritize comfort, mobility, cognitive clarity, and emotional wellbeing. A longer
            life is not inherently better if it increases confusion, pain, or anxiety.

            Hope is a powerful force—but in longevity medicine, it must be paired with science, ethics, and compassion. By recognizing
