          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Preparation Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Dogs thrive on predictability. Sudden schedule changes or emotional goodbyes
            can trigger anxiety, especially in first-time boarders. Preparing in advance
            reduces stress hormones like cortisol and helps your dog transition smoothly
            into a supervised, structured environment. A calm drop-off also reassures
            staff that your dog’s normal behaviors are based on comfort—not distress.
          </p>
          <p>
            The American Kennel Club (AKC, 2024) and Fear Free Pets (2025) both note that
            a confident owner is the single most effective buffer against separation
            stress. Dogs mirror our emotions; calm energy communicates safety.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Step 1 — Start Familiarization Early</h2>
          <p>
            If your dog has never been boarded, arrange a short trial day or overnight a
            few weeks in advance. This introduces staff, smells, and routines before a
            longer stay. Pair each visit with positive cues—such as a cheerful “go play!”
            and a high-value treat upon pickup.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Book meet-and-greets with staff and tour the facility together.</li>
            <li>Ask for a copy of daily schedules and feeding times to mirror at home.</li>
            <li>Let your dog explore drop-off and pickup areas without pressure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Repetition converts novelty into familiarity—one of the strongest confidence
            builders in canine learning theory (AVSAB, 2023).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Step 2 — Pack Smart and Scent-Based</h2>
          <p>
            Scent is your dog’s emotional anchor. Include a small blanket or T-shirt that
            smells like home; this triggers comfort pathways in the brain and helps lower
            heart rate during rest periods. Avoid washing these items right before
            boarding. Label everything clearly and avoid overpacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bring consistent food, measured in portions, along with written feeding and
            medication instructions. Irregular diets or missing doses can cause stomach
            upset or stress colitis (AVMA, 2023). If your facility offers a packing list,
            cross-check it with our&nbsp;

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Step 3 — Plan the Morning of Drop-Off</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Keep the morning routine calm—no last-minute rush or long play session.</li>
            <li>Feed a normal meal unless your daycare advises otherwise.</li>
            <li>Take a short leash walk to encourage toileting and relaxation.</li>
            <li>Deliver belongings and confirm emergency contacts with staff.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Avoid emotional farewells—no crouching, hugging, or prolonged eye contact.
            Instead, use a casual cue and walk away confidently. Dogs read hesitation as
            uncertainty, while neutral departures convey security.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Step 4 — Communicate Behavioral Needs</h2>
          <p>
            Transparency helps staff manage your dog safely. Disclose triggers such as
            guarding, anxiety around certain breeds, or medication side effects. Ethical
            facilities use this data to group dogs appropriately and maintain low stress
            playgroups. Behavior disclosure is collaboration, not confession.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many facilities now include emotional-wellness sections on intake forms—a
            positive trend aligning with Pet Care Services Association standards (PCSA, 2024).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Step 5 — Use Scent Cues for Pickup and Reunion</h2>
          <p>
            After boarding, dogs often smell like the facility environment. Bring a towel
            or blanket from home to re-transfer your household scent during pickup. This
            simple “scent bridge” helps your dog re-orient and reduces overexcitement upon
            returning home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allow quiet decompression time before reintroducing vigorous play or social
            visits. Veterinary behaviorists recommend 12–24 hours of rest to normalize
            cortisol after extended stays (Fear Free Pets, 2024).
          </p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Bonus Tips for Nervous Owners</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Ask for photo updates or daily text reports to maintain peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Keep your phone available but avoid excessive check-ins that can disrupt routines.</li>
            <li>For repeat boarders, rotate comfort items each stay to keep scents fresh.</li>
            <li>Use pheromone sprays (Adaptil®) on bedding for added calming effect.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Remember: trust is built over time. Each successful stay teaches both you and
            your dog that temporary separation can be calm and predictable.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The smoother the hand-off, the calmer the stay. Thoughtful preparation—trial
            visits, consistent cues, and scent comfort—turns boarding from a stressful
            necessity into a positive, repeatable routine. Dogs remember calm transitions;
            every low-stress goodbye makes the next one easier.
