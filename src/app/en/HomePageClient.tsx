After the 60 day period is up, our price is $1/month moving forward.

                                The creators of Petunia are also owners of a boarding and daycare facility — that’s how we got our start in this industry back in 2017. We know the daily challenges firsthand, because we’ve lived them.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-lg text-balance">
                                People who stay in this industry only stay for one reason: they love the animals. They sacrifice weekends, sleep, and margins of comfort to make life better for the dogs in their care. Your software should never punish that. You shouldn’t have to watch hard-earned money leak out of your pocket just to manage the basics. We don’t make you pay for our rent — we simply have our priorities straight. We wanted to build a software company that actually cared about the customer… and their wallets (important to not forget that last part!).
                                <br /><br />
                                Caring doesn’t mean overcharging; it means delivering the features that make your life easier, at a price that respects the work you do and the sacrifices you make. While families go away, they trust you to take care of their dog while they’re on vacation. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be able to afford a nice vacation as well!
                                <br /><br />
                                An incredibly small in-home boarding and daycare facility should not have to sacrifice features simply because they can’t afford them. And a large facility should not have to give up the fine-tuned features that smaller software packages offer. Right now, everyone on both sides of the fence is forced to compromise. We’re going to eliminate that.

                                This part of Petunia is coming in the first half of 2026! We&rsquo;re rolling out tools built specifically for sitters and walkers.

                                $1/month. No commissions, ever. Bring your existing clients and grow from there. Why should you be paying obscene prices for software, and then giving out your personal phone number so you don&rsquo;t lose significant portions of your hard earned money to larger software companies? Of course, you will encourage people to book directly through you so you can make more money! But you shouldn&rsquo;t have to do this at the sacrifice of your own personal privacy.

                                Petunia gives breeders a clean, organized way to track litters from the day puppies are born — without spreadsheets,
                                notebooks, or scattered files.
                            </p>

                                Create a record for each puppy, track body weights over time, store important health notes, and upload key documents
                                like vaccination records, veterinary physicals, and any additional paperwork you want to keep with the puppy&rsquo;s history.
                            </p>

                            <p className="text-lg text-balance">
                                When a puppy goes home, you can transfer ownership directly to the new owner so the puppy&rsquo;s records carry forward
                                seamlessly — helping families stay organized and helping you maintain a professional, transparent process.
